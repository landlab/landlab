Simple driver showing how to use the de Almeida's overland flow component in
Landlab. This driver sets up their test case from de Almeida et al., 2012,
where output from the Bates et al., 2010, de Almeida et al., 2012 and
analytical solutions are compared.

This is a componentized version of the driver example
overland_flow_with_model_grid_deAlmeida_analyticalSolution.py
