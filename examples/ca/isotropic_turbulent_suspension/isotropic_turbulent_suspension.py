def setup_transition_list():
    """
    Creates and returns a list of Transition() objects to represent state
    transitions for a biased random walk, in which the rate of downward
    motion is greater than the rate in the other three directions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    (none)

    Returns
    -------
    xn_list : list of Transition objects
        List of objects that encode information about the link-state transitions.

    Notes
    -----
    State 0 represents fluid and state 1 represents a particle (such as a
    sediment grain, tea leaf, or dissolved heavy particle).

    The states and transitions are as follows:

    Pair state      Transition to       Process             Rate (cells/s)
    ==========      =============       =======             ==============
