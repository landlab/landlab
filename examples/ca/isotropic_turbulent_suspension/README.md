## CellLab-CTS Model of Isostropic Turbulent Suspension

![] ()

CellLab-CTS model of grains suspended in a stirred (turbulent) fluid. 
Grain motion is modeled as a transition that switches the position of grain and fluid at a user-specified rate. 
In this example, we assume that the grains are 1 mm diameter tea leaves and the characteristic turbulent velocity fluctuation is 0.01 m/s, so that cell size equals 0.001 m and the mean transition rate is 10 cells/second.
