component rules
---------------


super is called in the init
all public attributes are properties
all outputs are verified with self._verify_output_fields() at the end of init


but components may also have other main methods at the developer's discretion.

A component author may choose to have a standard R1S method. If this is the
case it must either take dt, or nothing, and must return only a reference to
the grid.


we recommend that all arguments and keyword arguments have reasonable names (e.g., no Tmax, but temp_max instead). This is not required.


wherever possible arguments and keyword arguments have defaults.

checking for input and output vars done using base class.
When possible use base class methods to make output vars.
