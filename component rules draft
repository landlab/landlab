component rules
---------------
super is called in the init
all public attributes are properties
all outputs are verified with self._verify_output_fields() at the end of init

all components have a primary method called r1s that takes either nothing, or dt,
and returns a reference to the grid.

all arguments and keyword arguments have reasonable names (e.g., no Tmax, but temp_max instead)
wherever possible arguments and keyword arguments have defaults. 

creation of necessary input vars and output vars is done by base class via
header information is present.
