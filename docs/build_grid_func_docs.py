"""
This script builds several of Landlab's key grid documentation files, based
around Sphinx and the new LLCATS type declaration system. The files affected
are:

landlab.grid.base.rst
landlab.grid.raster.rst
landlab.grid.voronoi.rst
landlab.grid.radial.rst
landlab.grid.hex.rst

It takes the files named text_for_XXXX.py.txt, then uses these text blocks
coupled with lists of grid methods according to the LLCATS system to build the
above files, automatically.

This script is designed to be run as part of the commit process for LL.

Any changes made directly to the above files will be lost whenever this script
is run.
