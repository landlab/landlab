    "- **Unstable time step:**  \n",
    "  $$\\Delta t_{\\text{unstable}} = 5 \\, \\Delta t_{\\text{crit}}$$\n",

    "## Stable simulation (Δt << Δt₍crit₎)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The initial bump smooths out gradually.\n",
    "- The solution remains smooth and realistic.\n",

    "## Unstable simulation (Δt >> Δt₍crit₎)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The numerical solution develops artificial oscillations.\n",
    "- Elevation values overshoot and become distorted.\n",
