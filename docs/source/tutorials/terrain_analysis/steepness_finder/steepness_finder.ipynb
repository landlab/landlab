    "# Using the SteepnessFinder Component\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an input digital elevation model (DEM), the `SteepnessFinder` component calculates the **steepness index** for nodes or stream segments in the drainage network. The steepness index is measure of channel gradient that is normalized to compensate for the correlation between gradient and drainage area. The definition of the steepness index derives from an idealized mathematical relationship between channel gradient and drainage area,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S = k_{sn} A^\\theta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S$ is local channel gradient, $A$ is drainage area, $k_{sn}$ is the steepness index, and $\\theta$ is the **concavity index** (because its value reflects the upward concavity of the stream profile; a value of 0 would represent a linear profile with no concavity). The definition of steepness index is therefore\n",
    "\n",
    "$$k_{sn} = \\frac{S}{A^\\theta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The occurrence of an approximate power-law relationship between gradient and drainage area was noted by, for example, Hack (1957, his equation 2) and Flint (1974) (it is sometimes called \"Flint's Law\", John Hack having already had a different scaling relation named for him; see the *HackCalculator* component tutorial). The emergence of DEMs and computers powerful enough to analyze them opened the door to statistical exploration of the slope-area relation (Tarboton and Bras, 1989), and the recognition that the relationship can be interpreted in terms of geomorphic processes (Willgoose et al., 1991). The concavity and steepness indices are defined and discussed in Whipple and Tucker (1999). The steepness index, and the related metric the chi index (see the *ChiFinder* tutorial) have become widely used as methods for identifying anomalies in channel gradient that may related to tectonics, lithology, or landscape transience (see, e.g., Wobus et al., 2006; Kirby and Whipple, 2012)."

    "\n",
    "One challenge in extracting $k_{sn}$ from digital elevation data is noise: cell-to-cell variations in slope can make it hard to visualize coherent patterns, as the above example demonstrates. One solution, discussed by Wobus et al. (2006), is to use a fixed elevation drop: one starts from a given pixel and iterates from pixel-to-pixel downstream until the elevation difference from the starting point is equal to or greater than a specified drop distance. One advantage of this method prevents the analyzed segments from having zero slope. Another is that it effectively averages gradient over a longer horizontal distance that depends on the local gradient: lower gradients, which are generally more prone to noise, will be averaged over a longer distance, and vice versa. The example below shows how to do this with SteepnessFinder:"
