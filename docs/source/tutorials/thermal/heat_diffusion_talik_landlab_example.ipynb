    "# Heat diffusion: using Landlab to model the temperature field around an Arctic talik\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Greg Tucker, University of Colorado Boulder, May 2025)*\n",
    "\n",
    "The Arctic is famous for its permafrost: ground that remains below 0$^\\circ$C and frozen permanently, or at least for 2 years or more in a row. Yet there are exceptions to the permafrost rule. The ground beneath shallow lakes and rivers often forms what's known as a *talik*: an area of unfrozen ground that is held above the freezing point by virtue of its contact with seasonally unfrozen water at the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate how to create a 2D thermal model in Landlab, using as a motivating example a hypothetical talik. The model domain consists of a vertical slice of ground. The model calculates heat conduction through the slice, assuming an initial geothermal gradient. Geothermal heat flows in through the bottom boundary. The top boundary is split into two parts. One part, representing dry land, has a surface temperature that varies sinusoidally throughout each year. The other, representing a shallow lake, stays fixed at or near the freezing point. The model is highly simplified, representing only heat conduction, and omitting consideration of the heat taken in or released by phase changes (solid to liquid or the reverse).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation governing 2D heat conduction in a solid, with no internal sources or sinks, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho C_p} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T$ is temperature, $t$ is time, $\\rho$ is material density, and $C_p$ is the specific heat of the material (usually expressed in Joules per kilogram per degree). Here $\\mathbf{q} = [q_x, q_y]$ is the two-dimensional vector of heat flux (power per unit area, e.g., Watts per square meter). The symbol $\\nabla\\cdot$ represents the divergence operator,  defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla\\cdot \\equiv \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{\\mathbf{i}}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$ are unit vectors in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heat flux is given by Fourier's law:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{q} = -k \\nabla{T}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k$ is thermal conductivity (e.g., Watts per meter per Kelvin) and $\\nabla{T}$ is the temperature gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numerical implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses the Finite Volume Method, in which an average value of $T$ is tracked in each cell within a grid, in this case a regular rectilinear grid with square cells of dimensions $\\Delta x$ by $\\Delta x$. In a Landlab grid, each cell contains a grid *node*. The temperature gradient between each adjacent pair of nodes is calculated by taking the difference between $T$ at the two nodes and dividing by the distance between them (in this case, that distance is always equal to the grid spacing $\\Delta x$). Each adjacent pair of nodes is represented by a grid objected called a *link*: a directed line segment that extends from its *tail node* to its *head node*. Therefore, every value of temperature gradient calculated between nodes is assigned to the corresponding link. The sign of the gradient is taken in reference to the link's direction: if temperature at the head node is greater than at the tail node, then the gradient is positive; if the reverse, the gradient is negative, and if the two temperatures are equal, the gradient is of course zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The faces of each grid cell are associated with links. The heat flux per unit width across a cell face is calculated using Fourier's law, by multiplying the corresponding temperature gradient by $-k$. Once heat fluxes have been calculated for all of the cell faces, the *flux divergence* is calculated for each grid cell by multiplying each $q$ (in Watts per meter) by cell width and adding up the resulting total heat fluxes (now in Watts) coming in or out of the four cell faces. This total flux is then divided by cell area to get the flux divergence (in Watts per square meter).\n",

    "Next, run the time loop. The loop takes advantage of two of Landlab's numerical functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `calc_grad_at_link` calculates the gradient in the given quantity (in this case temperature) between each adjacent pair of grid nodes. The resulting gradient values are mapped to the *links* that connect the node pairs. Every link has a direction as well as a magnitude. For example, link 0, which connects nodes 0 and 1, \"points\" in the direction of node 1. Node 1 is said to be the \"head\" of link 0, and node 0 is said to be the \"tail\" of link 0. Here a positive value of gradient means that temperature increases in the direction of the link; a negative value means temperature decreases in the direction of the link.\n",

The flux quantity (here representing heat flux per unit width) is a link-based array passed as an argument to the function. The function then adds up the total flux crossing each face of the grid cell, and divides the result by the cell area. To be consistent with the mathematical definition of divergence, the resulting flux divergence is positive when the net flux is outward, and negative when it is inward (into the cell). The result is then assigned to each cell's corresponding grid node. Nodes around the perimeter of the grid don't have cells, so these nodes are simply assigned zero. The function then returns an array of divergence values, where the length of the array is equal to the number of grid nodes.\n",
