    "This notebook shows a toy example of how one might couple a simple groundwater model (Landlab's `GroundwaterDupuitPercolator`, by [Litwin et al. (2020)](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01935)) with an agent-based model (ABM) written using the [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) package.\n",

    "The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate the technical aspects of creating an integrated Landlab-Mesa model. The example is deliberately very simple in terms of the processes and interactions represented, and not meant to be a realistic portrayal of water-resources decision making. But the example does show how one might build a more sophisticated and interesting model using these basic ingredients.\n",
