    "# Setting watershed boundary conditions on a raster grid\n",

    "- This tutorial ilustrates how to set watershed boundary conditions on a raster grid.\n",
    "- Note that a watershed is assumed to have a ring of nodes around the core nodes that are closed boundaries (i.e. no flux can cross these nodes, or more correctly, no flux can cross the faces around the nodes).\n",
    "- This means that automatically the nodes on the outer perimeter of the grid will be set to be closed boundary.\n",
    "- By definitation a watershed also has one outlet through which fluxes can pass.  Here the outlet is set as the node that has the lowest value, is not a nodata_value node, and is adjacent to at least one closed boundary node.  \n",
    "- This means that an outlet can be on the outer perimeter of the raster.  However, the outlet does not need to be on the outer perimeter of the raster."
