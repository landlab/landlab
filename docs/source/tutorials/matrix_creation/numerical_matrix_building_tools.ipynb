    "# Building a matrix for numerical methods using a Landlab grid\n",
    "\n",
    "(Greg Tucker, University of Colorado Boulder, July 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "*This notebook explains how to use the matrix-building functions to construct a matrix for a finite-volume or finite-difference solution on a Landlab grid.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical solutions to differential equations often involve matrices. With grid-based numerical models, like those that Landlab is designed to support, the problem is *discretized* in space: we solve for one or more state variables of interest at a series of discrete spatial locations, such as a grid node or the cell that surrounds it. That process of discretization converts a partial differential equation into a set of ordinary differential equations, with one equation per point. Consider, for example, the one-dimensional diffusion equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = D\\frac{\\partial^2 \\eta}{\\partial x^2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $t$ is time, $x$ is distance, $D$ is a transport coefficient, and $\\eta$ could be concentration of a dissolved chemical (classic chemical diffusion), the temperature in a solid (heat diffusion), the velocity of flow in a viscous liquid (viscous momentum diffusion), or the height of the land on a hillslope (soil diffusion). If the domain is discretized such that we seek the value of $\\eta$ at a series of discrete points, then the above equation for a given point $i$ becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{d \\eta_i}{d t} = D\\frac{d^2 \\eta}{d x^2}\\bigg\\rvert_i\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the subscript at the right means \"evaluated at $i$\". Once the right side has been cast in terms of values of $\\eta$ at particular points, you end up with a linear system of equations, and matrix methods provide a natural way to solve them. One example among many is an implicit finite-difference solution to the one-dimensional form of the diffusion equation, which involves constructing a matrix and a \"right-hand side\" vector, inverting the matrix, and multiplying it by the vector to obtain a solution for the state variable at each grid node (for more on that particular example, see *Mathematical Modeling of Earth's Dynamical Systems* by Slingerland and Kump, or *Numerical Recipes* by Press et al.).\n",
    "\n",
    "When using matrix methods to solve a set of equation at discrete points, whether in 2D or 1D (or even 3D), you typically have an $MxM$ matrix, where $M$ is the number of solution points. Each row in the matrix represents the equation for one of the points. If the equation for a given point includes terms that represent, say, two of its immediately neighboring points, then the columns representing those two points contain non-zero entries. More generally, finite-volume and finite-difference matrices tend be sparse, with only a few non-zero entries in each row: the column that represents the point itself, and the columns representing its immediate neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building the matrix therefore requires knowledge of which points are connected to which other points in the grid. In 1D, this is easy. In 2D, it's a bit more complicated. Fortunately, the structure of a Landlab grid lends itself to this task. In particular, we know the connectivity for the *nodes* in the grid. It also turns out that when nodes are the solution points (as is typical), the number of equations---and thus $M$---corresponds exactly to the number of *core nodes* in the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we first work through the mathematics in a simple example: a finite-volume matrix solution to a steady diffusion equation with a source term, also known as a Poisson equation. We then show some worked examples of the Landlab matrix tools in action."

    "Let's take a step back in the derivation of the diffusion equation to note that it is composed of two parts together. One part is mass conservation:\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we'll set the time derivative to zero, meaning we are looking for a steady solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we integrate the conservation law over a 2D region $R$. In general, $R$ is a simply connected region. Ultimately for us, it will be a grid cell, which could be a square, a rectangle, a hexagon, or even an irregular polygon.\n",
    "\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we apply Green's theorem, which basically says that an area integral over the divergence of a vector field is equivalent to a line integral of the surface-normal component of that vector around the perimeter of the region. Intuitively, if we consider $\\mathbf{q}$ to be a flux in this case, what we're saying is that we can obtain the net total flux over the region (grid cell!) by integrating the flux all around the perimeter. Think of it as keeping track of all the people who enter or leave the perimeter of a playing field.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\oint_S \\mathbf{q} \\cdot\\mathbf{n} dS = U A_r\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "where $\\mathbf{n}$ is an (outward-facing) unit vector perpendicular to the perimeter $S$ that encloses region $R$. For us, again the perimeter is just the perimeter of the grid cell: the four sides of a square or rectangle, or the six side of a hexagon, the $N$ sides of a Voronoi polygon, or whatever. Then the line integral becomes a summation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will define a quantity $q$ that represents the face-normal component of $\\mathbf{q}$. The sign convention is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $q$ is positive if the vector orientation is toward the upper-right half space (including \"right\" and \"up\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- $q$ is negative if the vector orientation is toward the lower-left half space (including \"left\" and \"down\")\n",

    "We will also define a binary variable $\\delta$, which is negative if the outward surface-normal points toward the lower-left half space, and positive if it points toward the upper-right half space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's where Landlab grids come into the picture. The two definitions represent the use of *links* in a Landlab grid: when $q$ is positive when it oriented in the link's direction, and negative when oriented in the opposite direction. In a simple raster grid, where the links are all horizontal or vertical, the interpretation is very simple: flow to the right (increasing $x$) is positive, and to the left is negative; flow upward (increasing $y$) is positive, and downward is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, whatever the grid type, links by convention always \"point\" toward the upper-right half space; hence the general definition of $q$ above. The variable $\\delta$ represents the link orientation relative to the cell: positive when the link points out of the cell, negative when it points into the cell. The variable is represented in a Landlab grid by the array `link_dirs_at_node`: one for each link, starting from the \"east\" (or \"right\") direction and going counter-clockwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $R$ is a square grid cell of width $\\Delta x$. Then:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "where $q_k$ is the magnitude of the vector field at face $k$, and $\\delta = -1$ if the link at face $k$ points inward, and $+1$ if the link points outward.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this Poisson problem (i.e., diffusion with zero time derivative), the flux between the two nodes at either end of a link is approximated as the difference in $z$ divided by the distance, which here is $\\Delta x$. For each of the four directions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$q_e = -(D/\\Delta x) (z_e - z_i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$q_n = -(D/\\Delta x) (z_n - z_i)$\n",

    "\n",
    "$q_s = -(D/\\Delta x) (z_i - z_s)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the subscript refers to the four cardinal directions. When you work out the summation above, you get:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sum_{k=1}^4 q_k \\delta_k \\Delta x = -D (z_e + z_n - + z_w + z_s - 4z_i)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now plug this back into our governing equation, and divide both sides by $A_r = \\Delta x^2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "-D (z_e + z_n - + z_w + z_s - 4z_i) = U\n",

    "\\boxed{z_e + z_n - + z_w + z_s - 4z_i = -U/D}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So the above represents a system of equations: one equation per core node in a Landlab grid. For any given core node, $z_i$ is the elevation of the node itself, and the other four are the elevations of its four neighbors. By the way, for a regular raster grid, this finite-volume setup turns out to be the same as the finite-difference version. Here the directional subscripts will ultimately be replaced with indices of the particular neighboring nodes."

    "To facilitate matrix-based numerical solutions, Landlab's collection of utilities includes two helper functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_core_node_matrix(grid, value, rhs=None)` creates and returns a matrix like $A$ above for a Landlab grid, as well as a right-hand-side vector. The matrix is returned as an M x M numpy array, where M is the number of core nodes in the grid. The right-hand-side vector is an M x 1 array. Each row in the matrix represents one core node. The rules for building a row, and the corresponding row in the right-hand-side vector, are:\n",
    "  - For every *active link* connected to the node, if the link connects to another core node, the corresponding column in the matrix is assigned the value $+1$. For example, in the tiny grid presented earlier, core node 0 is connected to two other core nodes, 1 and 3. Therefore, columns 1 and 3 in row 0 of the matrix are each set to $+1$.\n",
    "  - The matrix column representing the node itself is assigned a value equal to $-1$ times the number of active links that connect to the node, which represents the number of neighboring nodes that are not closed-boundary nodes. In the example grid above, core node 0 is connected for four active links, and so row 0, column 0 is set to -4.\n",
    "  - All other matrix entries are zero.\n",
    "  - For every neighboring *fixed-value boundary* node adjacent to core node $i$, the value at the neighbor node is subtracted from column $i$ of the right-hand side vector. This is how a fixed-value boundary condition is handled. In the example grid above, core node 0 is bordered by two fixed-value boundary nodes (node IDs 1 and 5). The values of $z$ at these two fixed-value nodes are subtracted from row 0 of the right-hand-side boundary vector.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `get_core_node_matrix_var_coef(grid, value, coef_at_link=coef, rhs=None)` does basically the same thing, but allows for a spatially variable coefficient ($D$, or its equivalent in your particular problem). In the example above, we assumed that $D$ was constant, and were therefore able to move it to the right side of the equation. But there are plenty of cases where you might want to allow $D$ to vary in space. This function allows that by taking as an input a 1D array containing a value of $D$ for each grid link. The function ensures that $D$ is factored in appropropriately. (Exercise to the reader: use the example above, but with a spatially variable $D$, to work out what \"appropriately\" means here).  Note that when $D$ varies in space, it is included on the left side of the equation (i.e., in the matrix $A$) and **not** in the right-side vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both functions return two items: an M x M array (the matrix) and an M x 1 array (for the right-hand-side vector). With both functions, however, it is your job as the user to properly set up your right-hand-side vector. You have two options. The first is to pass in an array as the `rhs` argument. It should be a 1D array of length equal to the number of core nodes. The function will then add the boundary condition information to whatever values you have already put there. The second option is to omit the `rhs` argument. In this case the function will create a \"preliminary\" version that contains **only** the values needed to handle fixed-value boundary conditions; you must then add the rest of your right-side information to this before solving. For example, in the sample problem above, you would need to add $-U/D$ to each element of your right-hand-side vector, while the function would take care of adding the various boundary $z$ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both functions take either a `RasterModelGrid` or a `HexModelGrid` as the first argument. The matrix-creation functions work for both grid types. Note however that if you have a hex grid, you must multiply your right-hand-side vector by 3/2 (exercise: modify the derivation above, accounting for the area and side length of a hexagon, to demonstrate why this is the case).
