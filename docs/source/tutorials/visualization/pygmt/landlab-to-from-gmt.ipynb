    "### Projecting to UTM\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we transfer this DEM into the format of a Landlab `RasterModelGrid`, we need to address a drawback of having a DEM in geographic (lat-lon) coordinates. Landlab components that operate on terrain often expect the horizontal and vertical units to be the same; that is, the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the various grid elements are assumed to be in the same coordinate system and units as the field `topographic__elevation`. But in this example, so far we have a DEM that uses degrees for horizontal coordinates and meters for elevation values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get around this problem, we can project the DEM onto a coordinate system with distance-based rather than geographical coordinates in the horizontal. PyGMT provides a function to do this: `grdproject`. It uses interpolation to create a new grid with points now georeferenced in a given projected coordinate system. Here we'll project the grid data into the widely used the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system. Note that because grid projection involves interpolation, some information will be smeared out in the process.\n",

We'll display the PyGMT grid using `grdimage` and overlay coastlines using `coast`, coloring the oceans light blue. We'll use `text` to label the three largest islands, and add a `colorbar` at the bottom of the plot."
