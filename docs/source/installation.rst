  The following commands will install *landlab* into your current environment. Although
  not necessary, we **highly recommend** you install landlab into its own
  :ref:`virtual environment <virtual_environments>`.

.. include:: ../../README.rst
    :start-after: .. start-install-release
    :end-before: .. end-install-release

If you would like the very latest development version of *landlab* or want to modify
or contribute code to the *landlab* project, you will need to do a
:ref:`developer installation <install>` of *landlab* from source.
