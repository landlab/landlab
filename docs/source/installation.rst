Install
=======

.. note::

  In April 2020 Landlab switched to version 2.0. Landlab dropped
  support of Python 2.7 with this transition.

Release Install
---------------

.. important::

  The following commands will install *landlab* into your current environment. Although
  not necessary, we **highly recommend you install landlab into its own environment**.

.. include:: ../../README.rst
    :start-after: .. start-install-release
    :end-before: .. end-install-release

If you would like the very latest development version of *landlab* or want to modify
or contribute code to the *landlab* project, you will need to do a
:ref:`developer installation <install>` of *landlab* from source.
