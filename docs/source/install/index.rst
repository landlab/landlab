  If you would like the very latest development version of *landlab* or want to modify
  or contribute code to the *landlab* project, you will need to do a
  :ref:`developer installation <install>` of *landlab* from source.

  If you are only wanting to *use* *landlab*, please see the installation instructions
  in the :ref:`getting started <basic_install>` section.
