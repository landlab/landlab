Installation Instructions
=========================

If you want to use Landlab to explore Earth surface dynamics, this is almost
certainly the correct place to get install instruction. If you want to change
the Landlab source code go to the
:ref:`developer install instructions <developer_install>`.

In order to run Landlab you will need a python distribution. We recommend the
`Anaconda distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_
(version 3.6 or higher).

You can install Landlab using either the pip or conda package management tools.
We distribute Landlab through `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/landlab/>`_
and `conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/landlab>`_.

Conda instructions
------------------

Installation
````````````

If you want to use the new 2.0 beta version use the following command

.. code-block:: bash

  $ conda install landlab -c conda-forge/label/dev


If you work with many different packages that require conflicting dependencies,
consider reading about (and using)
`conda environments <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments>`_.

Additional Resources
--------------------

Over time the core Landlab development team has written resources for
different issues related to installation. These are below. Note that some are
very out of date. For example, one of them describes an installation of
python 2.7. We do not recommend installing a python 2.x version.
