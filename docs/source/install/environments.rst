Virtual Environments
====================

A virtual environment is a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular
version of Python along with additional packages. It solves the problem of one application's
package requirements conflicting with another's.

Two popular tools used for creating virtual environments are the built-in *venv* module and *conda*
(or the *much* faster and more reliable *mamba*). For virtual environments created using *conda*/*mamba*,
you can use either *conda*/*mamba* or *pip* to install additional packages, while *venv*-created environments
should stick with *pip*.

.. tab:: mamba

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        $ conda install mamba -c conda-forge
        $ mamba create -n landlab
        $ mamba activate landlab

.. tab:: conda

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        $ conda create -n landlab
        $ conda activate landlab

.. tab:: venv

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        $ python -m venv .venv
        $ source .venv/bin/activate

Note that you will need to activate this environment every time you want to use it in a new shell.
