====================
Guide for Developers
====================

If you're intending to make changes to the Landlab code base, or want to
develop your own components, this set of pages will provide information you
need.

The most important things to remember are to:

  * Start by creating a fork of Landlab's repository;
  * Make changes to the source code on a development branch, not the default
    `master` branch; and
  * Keep your fork's `master` and development branches up to date with changes
    in the main Landlab repository.
  * Consider creating a small Pull Request to update the page on
    :ref:`ongoing development <ongoing_development>` so that others know what
    you are working on.

Supported Python Versions
-------------------------
Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8

If you need to introduce a new dependency, that dependency must be compatible
with Python  3.6+.

There are a few pages that are particularly important for the maintenance of
the package. These are:

* :ref:`directory organization <organization>`
* :ref:`testing protocol <testing>`
* :ref:`dependency organization <dependencies>`, and
* :ref:`release workflow <dev_releases>`

If package maintainers change any of these, the prior pages likely need
updating.
