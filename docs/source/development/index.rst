Guide for Developers
====================

If you're intending to make changes to the Landlab code base, or want to
develop your own components, this set of pages will provide information you
need.

The most important things to remember are to:

    * Create a fork of Landlab's repository,
    * Make your changes to the source code on a development branch, and
    * Stay up to date with changes in the main Landlab repository.
