====================
Guide for Developers
====================

If you're intending to make changes to the Landlab code base, or want to
develop your own components, this set of pages will provide information you
need.

The most important things to remember are to:

  * Start by creating a fork of Landlab's repository;
  * Make changes to the source code on a development branch, not the default
    `master` branch; and
  * Keep your fork's `master` and development branches up to date with changes
    in the main Landlab repository.
