Recommendations and Rules for User-Contributed Components
=========================================================

Reference the component tutorial

Also the best practices tutorial.

First, thank you for considering contributing a component! The following are
some rules and recommendations.


TODO: Erkan suggests that we write that the reason we do each of these.
These are mostly for two reasons (better for users with some, but small overhead for developers, and pymt compatiblity)

Rules
-----
- ``super`` is called in the init
- All public attributes are properties
- A component uses all required inputs fields and creates all required output fields.
- Components have complete metadata in ``_info``.
- The component's ``__init__`` method takes a Landlab model grid as the first argument.
- The component has a main method that takes either ``dt`` or nothing. The name is descriptive but does not need to be standardized.
    * Solution is that using setters and getters or making a grid scalar.
    * Some common name patterns include `update()`, `run_one_step()`, or `calculate_name_of_thing()`.
- A component raises a ``ValueError`` if unused keyword arguments are provided.
- A component raises a ``ValueError`` if a grid type the component does not support is passed.
- Component fields use consistent definition and dimensions (not necessarily units).

Recommendations
---------------

- A component has a ``run_one_step`` method as its main method.
- Arguments and keyword arguments start with lower case letters.
- Keyword arguments have reasonable default values (and the grid is the only argument to ``__init__``.
- Can return or not return information. Some recommendations, Nothing, grid, or a ... or a calculated value.
