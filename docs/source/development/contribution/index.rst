Publication of Landlab Contributions
------------------------------------

A number of researchers have used the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)
and Geoscientific Model Development as a journal outlet to publish their
contribution to Landlab. There are a few aspects of the submission workflow for
JOSS that are non-standard and are described below.

In addition, the JOSS editorial board and the Landlab core development team are
presently (Jan 2019) working on defining some guidelines regarding what
contributions to Landlab fit the scope of a JOSS submission. These will be
summarized here when finalized. If you have any questions regarding whether
your potential JOSS submission is appropriate, the best thing to do is to
make a pre-submission inquiry with JOSS.
