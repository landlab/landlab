Style Guidelines and Enforcement
================================

General Coding Style
--------------------

-  Please stick to the coding style described by
   `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_. PEP8 is one of
   the standard worldwide stylistic conventions for coding in Python.

-  Class and function docstrings should follow the `numpydoc
   conventions <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard>`_.

-  Further, Landlab-specific advice for developing your own components
   can be found in the :ref:`component development guide <dev_contributing>`.

Many modern text editors, e.g., `Atom <https://atom.io>`_, provide interactive tools to
examine your code as you edit it and highlight where it diverges from
standards.


Style enforcement
-----------------

All tools used for development are specified in our `environment-dev.yml` file.
If you followed the
:ref:`developer installation instructions <developer_install>` you have
everything you need in the `landlab_dev` conda environment.

Currently we check for all the `flake8
violations <https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes>`_
and `pycodestyle
violations <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html>`_
except for (as defined in our ``setup.cfg``)

* E203: whitespace before
* E501: line too long (n > 88 characters)
* W503: line break before binary operator

To format files to meet these standards, we recommend using
`isort <https://pypi.org/project/isort/>`_ +
`black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_.

You can run

.. code-block:: bash

   $ make pretty

from the main landlab directory in a terminal to run both
`isort <https://pypi.org/project/isort/>`_ and
`black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ on your code.

To check if your files meet the standards that are enforced under
continuous integration, we use
`flake8 <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_. You can run

.. code-block:: bash

   make lint

from the top level directory or

.. code-block:: bash

   flake8 <file-to-check>
