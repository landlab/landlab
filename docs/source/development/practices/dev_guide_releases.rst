How to create a Landlab release
===============================

The Release Checklist
---------------------

1. Go to GitHub and use it to create a pull request that brings the
   changes associated with `landlab/landlab/master` into
   `landlab/landlab/release`.

2. Assuming the continuous integration from step 1 passes, merge the pull
   request into `landlab/landlab/release`.

3. Next, decide what new version number is appropriate
   based on `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_.

   This can either be done locally or on the GitHub website. Here are
   instructions to do this locally:

   In the `landlab/landlab` repository, checkout the release branch and tag it.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ git tag vX.X.X

   Then, push your tag on `landlab/landlab/release` to the remote.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ git push --tags

4. This will trigger both standard Landlab CI and a deploy stage that uploads
   wheels to PyPI. A new PR will be autogenerated in the landlab-feedstock on
   conda-forge.

   * Assuming its tests pass, merge the PR autogenerated in the landlab-feedstock.

   * Verify the builds on PyPI and on conda-forge.

Notes
-----

1. Although you can create such a tag on any branch, releases should **only**
   come from the ``release`` branch. Make sure that when you create a tag
   you are doing so on ``release`` (and all your changes are committed).

2. Landlab follows `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_
   rules for version assignment and formatting. Please stick to them.
