==========================================================
Landlab: A modular Earth Surface Dynamics modeling library
==========================================================


Landlab is a Python-based library that allows scientists and students to
build numerical landscape models. Designed for disciplines that quantify
earth surface dynamics such as geomorphology, hydrology, glaciology, and
stratigraphy, it can also be used in related fields.

Landlab provides components to compute flows (such as water, sediment,
glacial ice, volcanic material, or landslide debris) across a gridded
terrain. With its robust, reusable components, Landlab allows scientists
to quickly build landscape model experiments and compute mass balance
across scales.

If you are working with existing Landlab components, please also read the
:ref:`component documentation <api.components>`
to see if there are also specific publications linked to them. An example might be
`Adams et al. (2017) <https://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2016-277/>`_
for the OverlandFlow components. Table 5 in Hobley et al. (2017) also lists
many of these papers, as of the start of 2017.

A relatively new interface also automates the process of extracting citations
for landlab. `import landlab` when you write your model, then a call to
`landlab.registry.format_citations()` will list Bibtex-formatted citations for
all Landlab components that you currently have instantiated.
