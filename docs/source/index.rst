  The most current source code is always available from our `git
  repository <https://github.com/landlab/landlab>`_.

..
  If you are interested in the state of current development, we compile
  :ref:`ongoing development <ongoing_development>`. If you are interested in
  contributing but don't know how to get started (THANK YOU!),
  we compile :ref:`desired contributions <desired_contributions>` and have a
  :ref:`page all about development <development>`.

..
  Many Jupyter notebooks exist describing use of Landlab. Find an overview
  :ref:`here <tutorials>`. A subset of these notebooks are designed specifically
  for the classroom. Information about them and how to set them up for classroom
  use is described :ref:`on this page <teaching_tutorials>`.
