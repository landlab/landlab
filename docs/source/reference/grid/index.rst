Grid types
----------

Landlab presently supports five types of grids. The base class is ``ModelGrid``
with subclasses ``RasterModelGrid`` and ``VoronoiDelaunayGrid``.
``VoronoiDelaunayGrid`` has two further specialized subclasses: ``HexModelGrid``
and ``RadialModelGrid``. A final class is ``NetworkModelGrid``.

The following is an introduction to their properties and methods:
