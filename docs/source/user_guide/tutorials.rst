Tutorials
=========

The Landlab tutorials are Jupyter notebooks that give examples of Landlab core
concepts, component introductions, and teaching exercises.

Landlab's tutorials are located within the main Landlab repository in the
`notebooks <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/tree/master/notebooks>`_ folder.
They can also be accessed using
`Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/welcome.ipynb>`_.

If you write a Landlab tutorial or Gist, please contribute it via a pull request.
