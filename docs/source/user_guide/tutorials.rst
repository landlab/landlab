Tutorials
=========

The Landlab Tutorials are Jupyter notebooks that give examples of Landlab core
concepts, component introductions, and teaching exercises.

You can run the Tutorials using your local Landlab installation. The Tutorials
are located within the main Landlab repository in the
`notebooks <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/tree/master/notebooks>`_ folder.

Landlab Tutorials can also be accessed online with the source code stored on
Github. Launch these notebooks with the following link:
`Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/welcome.ipynb>`_.

If you write a Landlab Tutorial or Gist, please contribute it via a pull request.
