Standardization and deprecation within the component library
------------------------------------------------------------

- FlowRouter deprecated. Use FlowAccumulator
- No more flooded_nodes (use ``erode_flooded_nodes=True`` at init)
- Fewer different options for runoff rate, but one, consistent, good option
  (use argument to FlowAccumulator, then use ``surface__water_discharge`` for
  erosion).
- Removal of old deprecated methods such as (``erode``, ``diffuse``...)
- Main method now either take ``dt`` or nothing.


Some other functions/methods have been removed
