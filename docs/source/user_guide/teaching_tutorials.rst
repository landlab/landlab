Teaching Tutorials
==================

Landlab teaching tools
----------------------

This page describes the Jupyter Notebooks that implement Landlab for use in
teaching undergraduate and graduate courses. Jupyter Notebooks combine formatted
text with code that can be run. Students can run small parts of code bit by bit
as they follow along with the text.

The notebooks illustrate examples of physical processes implemented numerically.
These notebooks are designed to teach about processes. The notebooks are not
designed to teach students to code, or to teach students to use Landlab. No
coding experience is needed to successfully carry out these activities - just
the ability to read and a classroom introduction of the specific processes being
illustrated.

The notebooks are primarily designed for use as homework assignments or
laboratory assignments. However, they can be used to illustrate concepts
on-the-fly in the classroom.

The easiest way to see what is in the notebooks is through the
`Binder welcome page for the teaching notebooks <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/master?filepath=notebooks/teaching/welcome_teaching.ipynb>`_. This also allows you to run the notebooks online.
The tutorials can also be run online on
:ref:`EarthscapeHub <tutorials_EarthscapeHub>`.

The notebooks can also be run locally by `installing Landlab <https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/index.html>`_ on your computer.

For an introduction to using Jupyter Notebooks locally, see this `webpage <https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html>`_.
[Quick Summary: The way to launch a Jupyter notebook is to enter
'jupyter notebook' from a command line prompt. Jupyter notebooks can also be
launched from within Anaconda.]

More information
----------------

If you have suggestions on improving these notebooks and developing new ones,
or are having trouble running them, please leave us a question in our
`GitHub Issues page <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues>`_. Please make
sure you include that you are working with a Landlab Teaching Notebook and
include the name of the notebook and as much information as possible. If you
are getting an error, please taking a screenshot and upload it.

The development of these Notebooks has been made possible by the Landlab
project funded by the National Science Foundation (OAC 1450338 to N. Gasparini,
OAC 1450409 to G. Tucker, OAC 1450412 to E. Istanbulluoglu).
