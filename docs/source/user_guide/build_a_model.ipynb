    "\n",
    "In this section, we introduce you to how to\n",
    "actually use it to build models and work with the Landlab component library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Landlab requires that you build a Python script to import, instantiate,\n",
    "and then run your landscape model. We describe such a script as a **driver**.\n",
    "It's also possible to do the same set of processes on the fly in an interactive\n",
    "Python environment like iPython.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a driver file will consist of six distinct sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Import** the Python and Landlab libraries you'll need to run your model\n",
    "- **Instantiate** the Landlab elements (grid and, if using them, components)\n",
    "- **Load** any necessary data into the grid fields\n",
    "- Set the **boundary conditions**\n",
    "- **Run** the model, typically by creating a for loop or using a Landlab generator (see below)\n",
    "- **Finalize** and handle the data (e.g., plot, export)\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the driver, if you're using Landlab components, you'll probably also need\n",
    "a {ref}`parameter file<input-files>`. This file supplies the components with the additional\n",
    "parameter and setup information they need. Landlab parameter files are text\n",
    "files `.txt`, have fixed format, and for convenience (so you only have to\n",
    "specify the minimum of path information in the file name) should be placed in\n",
    "the same folder as the driver file. Find out more about parameter files\n",
    "{ref}`here<input-files>`. However, if you're not using components, there's little need\n",

    "This means that we need to \"instantiate\" the various Landlab objects such as\n",
    "the grid and the components that we will use to store data and run the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE**\n",
    "> most components require the grid object be passed to them as one of\n",
    "> their arguments during instantiation, so the first thing you'll want to\n",
    "> instantiate will be the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the docstrings for each class (grid, component) you want to instantiate\n",
    "for a detailed description of what you need to supply as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the grid class is the RasterModelGrid, labeled as `((i, j), [node_spacing])`. Here, `(i, j)` is a tuple where *i* is the number of rows and *j* the number of columns, and `node_spacing` is an optional second tuple or float. If you want uniform node spacing in the *y* and *x* directions, use a float, otherwise use a tuple to specify `(dy, dx)` if you want them to be different (see example immediately below). Spacing will default to (1., 1.). \n",
    "\n",
    "Landlab also recognizes an older style of RasterModelGrid signature, which looks like `(number_of_node_rows, number_of_node_columns, node_spacing(optional))`, and is clever enough to work with this form.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a VoronoiDelaunayGrid, the signature will be `(array_of_node_x_coords, array_of_node_y_coords)`. For a generic component, it will typically be `(ModelGrid, 'path_to_parameter_file.txt')`, though there may be some variation, and optional inputs may also be available.\n",
