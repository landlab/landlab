Introduction to Landlab's Gridding Library
******************************************

When creating a two-dimensional simulation model, often the most time-consuming and
error-prone task involves writing the code to set up the underlying grid. Irregular
(or "unstructured") grids are especially tricky to implement. Landlab's **ModelGrid**
package makes this process much easier, by providing a set of library routines for
creating and managing a 2D grid, attaching data to the grid, performing common input
and output operations, and  providing library functions that handle common numerical
operations such as calculating a field of gradients for a particular state variable.
By taking care of much of the overhead involved in writing grid-management code,
**ModelGrid** is designed to help you build 2D models quickly and efficiently, freeing you
to concentrate on the science behind the code.

Some of the things you can do with **ModelGrid** include:

- Create and configure a structured or unstructured grid in a one or a few lines of code
- Create various data arrays attached to the grid
- Easily implement staggered-grid finite-difference/finite-volume schemes
- Calculate gradients in state variables in a single line
- Calculate net fluxes in/out of grid cells in a single line
- Set up and run "link-based" cellular automaton models
- Switch between structured and unstructured grids without needing to change the rest of
  the code
- Develop complete, 2D numerical finite-volume or finite-difference models much more
  quickly and efficiently than would be possible using straight C, Fortran, Matlab, or
  Python code

Some of the Landlab capabilities that work with **ModelGrid** to enable easy numerical modeling include:

- Easily read in model parameters from a formatted text file
- Write grid and data output to netCDF files for import into open-source visualization
  packages such as ParaView and VisIt
- Create grids from ArcGIS-formatted ascii files
- Create models by coupling together your own and/or pre-built process components
- Use models built by others from process components


This document provides a basic introduction to building applications using Landlab's
**ModelGrid**. It covers: (1) how grids are represented, and (2) a set of tutorial examples
that illustrate how to build models using simple scripts.

How a Grid is Represented
-------------------------

.. _basic_grid_elements:

Basic Grid Elements
-------------------

.. figure:: images/grid_schematic_ab.png
    :figwidth: 80%
    :align: center

    *Figure 1*: Elements of a model grid. The main grid elements are nodes, links, cells,
    and faces.
    Less commonly used elements include corners, patches, and junctions. In the
    spring 2015 version of Landlab, **ModelGrid** can implement raster (a) and
    Voronoi-Delaunay (b) grids. Ordered subtypes of Voronoi-Delaunay grids—radial
    and hexagonal—are also available.
    (Note that not all links and patches are shown, and only one representative cell is
    shaded.)

:ref:`Figure 1 <basic_grid_elements>` illustrates
how **ModelGrid** represents a simulation grid. The
grid contains a set of *(x,y)* points called **nodes**. In a typical
finite-difference or finite-volume model, nodes are the locations at which one tracks
scalar state variables, such as water depth, land elevation, sea-surface elevation,
or temperature.

Each adjacent pair of nodes is connected by a line segment known as
a **link**. A link has both a position in space, denoted
by the coordinates of the two bounding nodes, and a direction: a link
runs from one node (known as its **from-node** or **tail-node**) to another node
(known as its **to-node** or **head-node**).

Every node in the grid interior is associated with a polygon known as a **cell** (illustrated,
for example, by the shaded square region in :ref:`Figure 1a <basic_grid_elements>`). Each cell is
bounded by a set of line segments known as **faces**, which it shares with its neighboring
cells.

In the simple case of a regular (raster) grid, the cells are square, the nodes
are the center points of the cells (:ref:`Figure 1 <basic_grid_elements>`), and the links and faces have
identical length (equal to the node spacing). In a Voronoi-Delaunay grid, the
cells are Voronoi polygons (also known as Theissen polygons)
(:ref:`Figure 1a <basic_grid_elements>`). In this case, each cell represents the surface area that
is closer to its own node than to any other node in the grid. The faces
represent locations that are equidistant between two neighboring nodes. Other grid
configurations are possible as well. The spring 2015 version of Landlab includes
support for hexagonal and radial grids, which are specialized versions of the
Voronoi-Delaunay grid shown in :ref:`Figure 1a <basic_grid_elements>`. Note that the node-link-cell-face
topology is general enough to represent other types of grid; for example, one could use
**ModelGrid's** data structures to implement a quad-tree grid,
or a Delaunay-Voronoi grid in which cells are triangular elements with
nodes at their circumcenters.

Creating a Grid
---------------

Creating a grid is easy.  The first step is to import Landlab's
:py:class:`RasterModelGrid <landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid>` class (this
assumes you have :ref:`installed Landlab <install>`
and are working in your favorite
:ref:`Python environment <python_installation>`):

.. code-block:: python

    from landlab import RasterModelGrid

Now, create a regular (raster) grid with 10 rows and 40 columns, with a node spacing (dx) of 5:

.. code-block:: python

    mg = RasterModelGrid((10, 40), 5.)

*mg* is now a grid object with 400 ``( 10*40 )`` nodes and 750 ``( 40*(10-1) + 30*(10-1) )`` links.

.. code-block:: python

    mg.number_of_node_columns
    40
    mg.number_of_nodes
    400
    mg.number_of_links
    750

.. _fields:

Adding Data to a Landlab Grid Element using Fields
--------------------------------------------------

Landlab has a data structure called *fields* that will store data associated with different types
of grid elements. Fields are convenient because 1) fields create data arrays of the proper length for
the associated grid element, and 2) fields attach these data to the grid, so that any piece of code that has
access to the grid also has access to the data stored in fields.

Suppose you would like like to
track the elevation at each node. The following code creates a data field
(array) called *elevation*. In this case, we'll use the grid method
*add_zeros* to create a field that initially sets all values in the field to
zero (we'll explain how to read in elevation values from a file in the section
on :ref:`DEMs below <importing_a_dem>`). The *add_zeros* method takes
two arguments: the name of the grid element (in this case, *node*, in the
singular) and a name we choose for the value in the data field (here we'll just
call it *elevation*). Each *elevation* value in the data field is then
associated with a specific grid node. The data field is just a NumPy array
whose length is equal to the number of nodes in the grid.

.. code-block:: python

    z - mg.add_zeros('node', 'elevation')

Here *z* is an array of zeros. We can verify that *z* has the same length as the number of nodes:

.. code-block:: python

    z.size  #or len(z)
    400

Note that *z* is a reference to the data stored in the model field. This means that if you change z, you
also change the data in the ModelGrid's elevation field. Therefore, you can access and manipulate data in the field either through the variable *z* or through the grid, as in the following examples:

.. code-block:: python

    mg.at_node['elevation'][5] - 1000.

or the alternative notation:

.. code-block:: python

    mg['node']['elevation'][5]
    1000.

Now the sixth element in the model's elevation field array, or in *z*, is equal to 1000.  (Remember that the first element of a Python array has an index of 0 (zero)).

You can see all of the field data available at the nodes on *mg* with the following:

.. code-block:: python

    mg.at_node.keys()
    ['elevation']

You may recognize this as a dictionary-type structure, where
the keys are the names (as strings) of the data arrays.

There are currently no data values (fields) assigned to the links, as shown by the following:

.. code-block:: python

    mg.at_link.keys()
    []

It is also possible, and indeed, often quite useful, to initialize a field from an
existing NumPy array of data. You can do this with the
:py:func:`add_field <landlab.field.grouped.ModelDataFields.add_field>` method.
This method allows slightly more granular control over how the field gets
created. In addition to the grid element and field name, this method takes an
array of values to assign to the field. Optional arguments include: ``units-``
to assign a unit of measurement (as a string) to the value, ``copy-`` a boolean
to determine whether to make a copy of the data, and ``clobber-`` a boolean
that prevents accidentally overwriting an existing field.

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    elevs_in - np.random.rand(mg.number_of_nodes)
    mg.add_field('node', 'elevation', elevs_in, units-'m', copy-True, clobber-False)

Fields can store data at nodes, cells, links, faces, patches, junctions, and corners (though the
latter two or three are very rarely, if ever, used). The grid element you select is
described in Landlab jargon as that field's *centering* or *group*, and you will
sometimes see these terms used as input parameters to various grid methods.

To access only the core nodes, core cells, active links, or some other subset of node values using the
properties available through the ModelGrid, you can specify a subset of the field data array. For example, if we wanted to determine the elevations at core nodes only we can do the following:

.. code-block:: python

    core_node_elevs - mg.at_node['elevation'][mg.core_nodes]

The first set of brackets, in this case *elevation*, indicates the field data array, and the second set of brackets, in this case *mg.core_nodes* (itself an array of core node IDs), is a NumPy filter that specifies which *elevation* elements to return.

Here is another example of initializing a field with the *add_ones* method. Note that when initializing a field, the singular of the grid
element type is provided:

.. code-block:: python

    veg - mg.add_ones('cell', 'percent_vegetation')
    mg.at_cell.keys()
    ['percent_vegetation']

Here *veg* is an array of ones that has the same length as the number of cells. Because there are
no cells around the edge of a grid, there are fewer cells than nodes:

.. code-block:: python

    mg.at_cell['percent_vegetation'].size
    304

As you can see, fields are convenient because you don't have to keep track of how many nodes, links, cells, etc.
there are on the grid. It is easy for any part of the code to query what data are already associated with the grid and operate on these data.

You are free to call your fields whatever you want. However, field names are
more useful if standardized across components. If you are writing a Landlab component
you should use :ref:`Landlab's standard names <component_standard_names>`.
Standard names for fields in a particular component can be
accessed individually through the properties
*component_instance._input_var_names* and *component_instance._output_var_names*
(returned as dictionaries), and are listed in the docstring for each component.

.. code-block:: python

    from landlab.components.flexure import Flexure
    flexer - Flexure(rg)
    flexer._input_var_names
    {'lithosphere__elevation',
     'lithosphere__overlying_pressure',
     'planet_surface_sediment__deposition_increment'}
    flexer._output_var_names
    {'lithosphere__elevation', 'lithosphere__elevation_increment'}

We also maintain this list of all the
:ref:`Landlab standard names <component_standard_names>`.

Our fields also offer direct compatibility with `CSDMS's standard naming system for
variables <https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/CSDMS_Standard_Names>`_.
However, note that, for ease of use and readability, Landlab standard
names are typically much shorter than CSDMS standard names. We anticipate that future
Landlab versions will be able to automatically map from Landlab standard names to CSDMS
standard names as part of Landlab's built-in `Basic Model Interface for CSDMS
compatibility <https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/BMI_Description>`_.

The following gives an overview of the commands you can use to interact with the grid fields.

Field initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``grid.add_empty(name, at-"group", units-'-')``
* ``grid.add_ones(name, at-"group", units-'-')``
* ``grid.add_zeros(name, at-"group", units-'-')``

"group" is one of 'node', 'link', 'cell', 'face', 'corner', 'junction', 'patch'

"name" is a string giving the field name

"units" (optional) is a string denoting the units associated with the field values.


Field creation from existing data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``grid.add_field(name, value_array, at-"group", units-'-', copy-False, clobber-True)``

Arguments as above, plus:

"value_array" is a correctly sized numpy array of data from which you want to create the field.

"copy" (optional) if True adds a *copy* of value_array to the field; if False, creates a reference to value_array.

"clobber" (optional) if `False`, raises an exception if a field called name already exists.


Field access
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``grid.at_node`` or ``grid['node']``
* ``grid.at_cell`` or ``grid['cell']``
* ``grid.at_link`` or ``grid['link']``
* ``grid.at_face`` or ``grid['face']``
* ``grid.at_corner`` or ``grid['corner']``
* ``grid.at_junction`` or ``grid['junction']``
* ``grid.at_patch`` or ``grid['patch']``

Each of these is then followed by the field name as a string in square brackets, e.g.,

>>> grid.at_node['my_field_name'] #or
>>> grid['node']['my_field_name']

You can also use these commands to create fields from existing arrays,
as long as you don't want to take advantage of the added control ``add_field()`` gives you.


.. _getting_info_about_fields:

Getting information about fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Landlab offers a command line interface that lets you find out about all the fields that are in use across all the Landlab components. You can find out the following:

``$ landlab used_by [ComponentName]``  # What fields does ComponentName take as inputs?

``$ landlab provided_by [ComponentName]``  # What fields does ComponentName give as outputs?

``$ landlab uses [field__name]``  # What components take the field field__name as an input?

``$ landlab provides [field__name]``  # What components give the field field__name as an output?

``$ landlab list``  # list all the components

``$ (landlab provided_by && landlab used_by) | sort | uniq``  # some command line magic to see all the fields currently used in components


Representing Gradients in a Landlab Grid
----------------------------------------

Finite-difference and finite-volume models usually need to calculate spatial
gradients in one or more scalar variables, and often these gradients are
evaluated between pairs of adjacent nodes. ModelGrid makes these calculations
easier for programmers by providing built-in functions to calculate gradients
along links and allowing applications to associate an array of gradient values
with their corresponding links or edges. The `tutorial examples
<https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/welcome.ipynb>`_
illustrate how this capability can be used to create models of processes
such as diffusion and overland flow.

Here we simply illustrate the method for
calculating gradients on the links.  Remember that we have already created the
elevation array z, which is also accessible from the elevation field on *mg*.

.. code-block:: python

    gradients - mg.calculate_gradients_at_active_links(z)

Now gradients have been calculated at all links that are active, or links on which
flow is possible (see boundary conditions below).


Other Grid Elements
-------------------

The cell vertices are called *corners* (`Figure 1, solid squares <basic_grid_elements>`).
Each face is therefore a line segment connecting two corners. The intersection
of a face and a link (or directed edge) is known as a *junction*
(:ref:`Figure 1, open diamonds <basic_grid_elements>`). Often, it is useful to calculate scalar
values (say, ice thickness in a glacier) at nodes, and vector values (say, ice
velocity) at junctions. This approach is sometimes referred to as a
staggered-grid scheme. It lends itself naturally to finite-volume methods, in
which one computes fluxes of mass, momentum, or energy across cell faces, and
maintains conservation of mass within cells.  (In the spring 2015 version of Landlab,
there are no supporting functions for the use of junctions, but support is imminent.)

Notice that the links also enclose a set of polygons that are offset from the
cells. These secondary polygons are known as *patches* (:ref:`Figure 1,
dotted <basic_grid_elements>`). This means that any grid comprises two complementary tesselations: one
made of cells, and one made of patches. If one of these is a Voronoi
tessellation, the other is a Delaunay triangulation. For this reason, Delaunay
triangulations and Voronoi diagrams are said to be dual to one another: for any
given Delaunay triangulation, there is a unique corresponding Voronoi diagram.
With **ModelGrid,** one can
create a mesh with Voronoi polygons as cells and Delaunay triangles as patches
(:ref:`Figure 1b <basic_grid_elements>`). Alternatively, with a raster grid, one simply has
two sets of square elements that are offset by half the grid spacing
(:ref:`Figure 1a <basic_grid_elements>`). Whatever the form of the tessellation, **ModelGrid** keeps
track of the geometry and topology of the grid. patches can be useful for processes
like calculating the mean gradient at a node, incorporating influence from its
neighbors.

Managing Grid Boundaries
------------------------

An important component of any numerical model is the method for handling
boundary conditions. In general, it's up to the application developer to manage
boundary conditions for each variable. However, **ModelGrid** makes this task a bit
easier by tagging nodes that are treated as boundaries (*boundary nodes*)
and those that are treated as regular nodes belonging to the interior
computational domain (*core nodes*). It also allows you to de-activate ("close")
portions of the grid perimeter, so that they effectively act as walls.

Let's look first at how ModelGrid treats its own geometrical boundaries. The
outermost elements of a grid are nodes and links (as opposed to corners and
faces). For example, :ref:`Figure 2 <raster4x5>` shows a sketch of a regular
four-row by five-column grid created by RasterModelGrid. The edges of the grid
are composed of nodes and links. Only the inner six nodes have cells around
them; the remaining 14 nodes form the perimeter of the grid.

.. _raster4x5:

.. figure:: images/example_raster_grid.png
    :figwidth: 80%
    :align: center

    Figure 2: Illustration of a simple four-row by five-column raster grid created with
    :py:class:`landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid <landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid>`.
    By default, all perimeter
    nodes are tagged as open (fixed value) boundaries, and all interior cells
    are tagged as core. An active link is one that connects either
    two core nodes, or one core node and one open boundary node.

All nodes are tagged as either *boundary* or *core*. Those on the
perimeter of the grid are automatically tagged as boundary nodes. Nodes on the
inside are *core* by default, but it is possible to tag some of them as
*boundary* instead (this would be useful, for example, if you wanted to
represent an irregular region, such as a watershed, inside a regular grid). In the example
shown in :ref:`Figure 2 <raster4x5>`, all the interior nodes are *core*, and all
perimeter nodes are *open boundary*.

Boundary nodes are flagged as either *open* or *closed*, and links are tagged as
either *active* or *inactive* (Figure 3).

.. _raster4x5openclosed:

.. figure:: images/example_raster_grid_with_closed_boundaries.png
    :figwidth: 80 %
    :align: center

    Figure 3: Illustration of a simple four-row by five-column raster grid with a
    combination of open and closed boundaries.

A closed boundary is one at which no flux is permitted enter or leave, ever.
By definition, all links coming into or out of a closed boundary node must be inactive.
There is effectively no value assigned to a closed boundary; it will probably have a
grid.BAD_INDEX_VALUE or null value of some kind.
An open boundary is one at which flux can enter or leave, but whose value is controlled
by some boundary condition rule, updated at the end of each timestep.

An *active link*
is one that joins either two core nodes, or one *core* and one
*open boundary* node (Figure 3). You can use this
distinction in models to implement closed boundaries by performing flow
calculations only on active links, as seen in `this tutorial
<https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/tutorials/fault_scarp_notebook/landlab-fault-scarp.ipynb>`_.


.. _bc_details:

Boundary condition details and methods
--------------------------------------

A call to mg.node_status returns the codes representing the boundary condition
of each node in the grid. There are 5 possible types, they are stored on the
model grid:

* mg.BC_NODE_IS_CORE (Type 0)
* mg.BC_NODE_IS_FIXED_VALUE (Type 1)
* mg.BC_NODE_IS_FIXED_GRADIENT (Type 2)
* mg.BC_NODE_IS_LOOPED (Type 3, used for looped boundaries)
* mg.BC_NODE_IS_CLOSED (Type 4)

A number of different methods are available to you to interact with (i.e., set and
update) boundary conditions at nodes. Landlab is smart enough to automatically
initialize new grids with fixed value boundary conditions at all perimeters and core
nodes for all interior nodes, but if you want something else, you'll need to modify
the boundary conditions.

If you are working with a simple Landlab raster where all interior nodes are core and
all perimeter nodes are boundaries, you will find useful the set of commands:

* ``mg.set_closed_boundaries_at_grid_edges(right, top, left, bottom)``
* ``mg.set_fixed_value_boundaries_at_grid_edges(right, top, left, bottom)``
* ``mg.set_fixed_link_boundaries_at_grid_edges(right, top, left, bottom, link_value-None)``
* ``mg.set_looped_boundaries(top_bottom_are_looped, left_right_are_looped)``

Where right, top, left, bottom are all booleans. See the relevant docstring for each
method for more detailed information.

If you are working with an imported irregularly shaped raster grid, you can close nodes
which have some fixed NODATA value in the raster using:

* ``mg.set_nodata_nodes_to_closed(node_data, nodata_value)``

Note that all of these commands will treat the status of node links as slave to the
status of the nodes, as indicated in Figure 3.
Links will be set to active or inactive according to what you set the node boundary
conditions as, when you call each method.

If you are working on an irregular grid, or want to do something more complicated
with your raster boundary conditions, you will need to modify the
``grid.status_at_node`` array by hand, using indexes to node IDs. Simply import the
boundary types from landlab then set the node statuses. The links will be updated
alongside these changes automatically:

.. code-block:: python

    mg - RasterModelGrid((5,5))
    mg.set_closed_boundaries_at_grid_edges(False, True, False, True)
    mg.number_of_active_links
    18
    mg.status_at_node[[6, 8]] - mg.BC_NODE_IS_CLOSED
    mg.status_at_node.reshape((5,5))
    array([[4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
           [1, 4, 0, 4, 1],
           [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
           [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
           [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]], dtype-int8)
    mg.number_of_active_links  # links were inactivated automatically when we closed nodes
    12

Note that while setting Landlab boundary conditions on the grid is straightforward, it
is up to the individual developer of each Landlab component to ensure it is compatible
with these boundary condition schemes! Almost all existing components work fine with
core, closed, and fixed_value conditions, but some may struggle with fixed_gradient,
and most will struggle with looped. If you're working with the component library, take
a moment to check your components can understand your implemented boundary conditions!
See the :ref:`Component Developer's Guide <dev_contributing>` for more information.


Using a Different Grid Type
---------------------------

As noted earlier, Landlab provides several different types of grid. Available grids
(as of this writing) are listed in the table below. Grids are designed using Python
classes, with more specialized grids inheriting properties and behavior from more
general types. The class hierarchy is given in the second column, **Inherits from**.

+-------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+
| Grid type               | Inherits from           | Node arrangement   | Cell geometry     |
+=========================+=========================+====================+===================+
| ``RasterModelGrid``     | ``ModelGrid``           | raster             | squares           |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+
| ``VoronoiDelaunayGrid`` | ``ModelGrid``           | Delaunay triangles | Voronoi polygons  |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+
| ``HexModelGrid``        | ``VoronoiDelaunayGrid`` | triagonal          | hexagons          |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+
| ``RadialModelGrid``     | ``VoronoiDelaunayGrid`` | concentric         | Voronoi polygons  |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+

:py:class:`landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid <landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid>`
gives a regular (square) grid, initialized
with *number_of_node_rows*, *number_of_node_columns*, and a *spacing*.
In a :py:class:`landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid <landlab.grid.voronoi.VoronoiDelaunayGrid>`,
a set of node coordinates
is given as an initial condition.
Landlab then forms a Delaunay triangulation, so that the links between nodes are the
edges of the triangles, and the cells are Voronoi polygons.
A :py:class:`landlab.grid.hex.HexModelGrid <landlab.grid.hex.HexModelGrid>` is a
special type of VoronoiDelaunayGrid in which the Voronoi cells happen to be
regular hexagons.
In a :py:class:`landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid <landlab.grid.radial.RadialModelGrid>`, nodes are created in concentric
circles and then connected to
form a Delaunay triangulation (again with Voronoi polygons as cells).

.. _importing_a_dem:

Importing a DEM
---------------

Landlab offers the methods
:py:func:`landlab.io.esri_ascii.read_esri_ascii <landlab.io.esri_ascii.read_esri_ascii>` and
:py:func:`landlab.io.netcdf.read_netcdf <landlab.io.netcdf.read_netcdf>` to allow ingestion of
existing digital elevation models as raster grids.

**read_esri_ascii** allows import of an ARCmap formatted ascii file (.asc or .txt)
as a grid.
It returns a tuple, containing the grid and the elevations in Landlab ID order.
Use the *name* keyword to add the elevation to a field in the imported grid.

.. code-block:: python

    from landlab.io import read_esri_ascii
    (mg, z) - read_esri_ascii('myARCoutput.txt', name-'topographic__elevation')
    mg.at_node.keys()
    ['topographic__elevation']

**read_netcdf** allows import of the open source netCDF format for DEMs. Fields will
automatically be created according to the names of variables found in the file.
Returns a :py:class:`landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid <landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid>`.

.. code-block:: python

    from landlab.io.netcdf import read_netcdf
    mg - read_netcdf('mynetcdf.nc')


After import, you can use :py:func:`landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.set_nodata_nodes_to_closed
<landlab.grid.base.ModelGrid.set_nodata_nodes_to_closed>`
to handle the boundary conditions in your imported DEM.

Equivalent methods for output are also available for both esri ascii
(:py:func:`landlab.io.esri_ascii.write_esri_ascii <landlab.io.esri_ascii.write_esri_ascii>`)
and netCDF
(:py:func:`landlab.io.netcdf.write_netcdf <landlab.io.netcdf.write_netcdf>`) formats.


.. _plotting_and_vis:

Plotting and Visualization
--------------------------

Visualizing a Grid
------------------

Landlab offers a set of matplotlib-based plotting routines for your data. These exist
in the landlab.plot library. You'll also need to import some basic plotting functions
from pylab (or matplotlib) to let you control your plotting output: at a minimum **show**
and **figure**. The most useful function is called
:py:func:`landlab.plot.imshow.imshow_node_grid <landlab.plot.imshow.imshow_node_grid>`, and is imported
and used as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from landlab.plot.imshow import imshow_node_grid
    from pylab import show, figure
    mg - RasterModelGrid(50,50, 1.) #make a grid to plot
    z - mg.node_x *0.1 #make an arbitrary sloping surface
    #create the data as a field
    mg.add_field('node', 'topographic_elevation', z, units-'meters',
    copy-True)
    figure('Elevations from the field') #new fig, with a name
    imshow_node_grid(mg, 'topographic_elevation')
    figure('You can also use values directly, not fields')
    #...but if you, do you'll lose the units, figure naming capabilities, etc
    imshow_node_grid(mg, z)
    show()

Note that :py:func:`landlab.plot.imshow.imshow_node_grid <landlab.plot.imshow.imshow_node_grid>`
is clever enough to examine the grid object you pass it,
work out whether the grid is irregular or regular, and plot the data appropriately.

By default, Landlab uses a Python colormap called *'pink'*. This was a deliberate choice
to improve Landlab's user-friendliness to the colorblind in the science community.
Nonetheless, you can easily override this color scheme using the keyword *cmap* as an
argument to imshow_node_grid. Other useful built in colorschemes are *'bone'* (black
to white), *'jet'*, (blue to red, through green), *'Blues'* (white to blue), and
*'terrain'* (blue-green-brown-white) (note these names are case sensitive).
See `the matplotlib reference guide
<https://matplotlib.org//examples/color/colormaps_reference.html>`_ for more options.
Note that imshow_node_grid takes many of the same keyword arguments as, and is designed
to resemble, the standard matplotlib function `imshow
<https://matplotlib.org//users/image_tutorial.html>`_. See also the method help for more
details.
In particular, note you can set the maximum and minimum you want for your colorbar using
the keywords *vmin* and *vmax*, much as in similar functions in the matplotlib library.

**Note if using Anaconda**: there have been documented issues with resolution with default inline plotting within the Spyder IDE iPython console. To generate dynamic plots (e.g. Matlab-like plots), change the graphics settings in Spyder by following this work flow:

In *Spyder -> Preferences -> iPython console -> Graphics -> Graphics Backend -> Automatic -> Apply -> OK -> Make sure to restart Spyder to update the preferences.*

Visualizing transects through your data
---------------------------------------

If you are working with a regular grid, it is trivial to plot horizontal and vertical
sections through your data. The grid provides the method
:py:func:`landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.node_vector_to_raster <landlab.grid.raster.RasterModelGrid.node_vector_to_raster>`,
which will turn a Landlab 1D node data array into a two dimensional rows*columns NumPy array,
which you can then take slices of, e.g., we can do this:

.. code-block:: python

    from pylab import plot, show
    mg - RasterModelGrid(10,10, 1.)
    z - mg.node_x *0.1
    my_section - mg.node_vector_to_raster(z, flip_vertically-True)[:,5]
    my_ycoords - mg.node_vector_to_raster(mg.node_y, flip_vertically-True)[:,5]
    plot(my_ycoords, my_section)
    show()


Visualizing river profiles
--------------------------

See the :py:class:`ChannelProfiler <landlab.components.profiler.ChannelProfiler>`
component.

Making Movies
-------------

Landlab does have an experimental movie making component. However, it has come to the
developers' attention that the matplotlib functions it relies on in turn demand that
your machine already has installed one of a small set of highly temperamental open
source video codecs. It is quite likely using the component in its current form is
more trouble than it's worth; however, the brave can take a look at the library
:py:mod:`landlab.plot.video_out <landlab.plot.video_out>`. We intend to improve
video out in future Landlab releases.

For now, we advocate the approach of creating an animation by saving separately
individual plots from, e.g., **plot()** or
:py:func:`landlab.plot.imshow.imshow_node_grid <landlab.plot.imshow.imshow_node_grid>`,
then stitching them together
into, e.g., a gif using external software. Note it's possible to do this directly from
Preview on a Mac.
