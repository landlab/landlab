Landlab is a Python-based library that allows scientists and students to
build numerical landscape models. Designed for disciplines that quantify
earth surface dynamics such as geomorphology, hydrology, glaciology, and
stratigraphy, it can also be used in related fields.

Landlab provides components to compute flows (such as water, sediment,
glacial ice, volcanic material, or landslide debris) across a gridded
terrain. With its robust, reusable components, Landlab allows scientists
to quickly build landscape model experiments and compute mass balance
across scales.

Dive in to using Landlab with the [[User Guide \| User-Guide]] and `this
overview manuscript <http://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/5/21/2017/>`__.
