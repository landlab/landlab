A guide to Landlab's classes and code.

Grids
=====

An extensive index to the Landlab grid and its methods is found on
:py:mod:`the following page <landlab.grid>`. Below is a short hyperlinked
summary.

Grid types
----------

As of Landlab version 1.5.5, there are five types of Landlab grid:

-  :ref:`Raster <Raster>`
-  :ref:`Voronoi-Delaunay <Voronoi>`
-  :ref:`Hex <Hex>`
-  :ref:`Radial <Radial>`
-  :ref:`Network <Network>`

The base class is ``ModelGrid`` with subclasses ``RasterModelGrid`` and
``VoronoiDelaunayGrid``.

``VoronoiDelaunayGrid`` has two further specialized subclasses: ``HexModelGrid``
and ``RadialModelGrid``.

A final class is ``NetworkModelGrid``.

Specialized methods and properties for Rectilinear Grids 'raster grids'
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Landlab's rectilinear grids are implemented by the class ``RasterModelGrid``,
which inherits from ``ModelGrid`` and adds the following:

   landlab.grid.raster

Specialized methods and properties for Voronoi-Delaunay grids
-------------------------------------------------------------

Landlab's Voronoi-Delaunay grids are implemented by the class
``VoronoiDelaunayGrid``, which inherits from ``ModelGrid`` and adds the following:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3

   landlab.grid.voronoi

Specialized methods and properties for hex grids
------------------------------------------------

Landlab's hex/trigonal grids are implemented by the class ``HexModelGrid``,
which inherits from ``VoronoiDelauneyGrid`` and adds the following:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3

   landlab.grid.hex

Specialized methods and properties for radial grids
---------------------------------------------------

Landlab's radial grids are implemented by the class ``RadialModelGrid``, which
inherits from ``VoronoiDelauneyGrid`` and adds the following:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3

   landlab.grid.radial


Specialized methods and properties for network grids
----------------------------------------------------

Landlab's network grids are implemented by the class ``NetworkModelGrid``,
which inherits from ``Graph`` and ``GraphFields`` and adds the following:

   landlab.grid.network

Values
======

The Landlab values submodule provides capabilities to generate synthetic values for
model grid fields.

   landlab.values


Layers
======

Landlab has the ability to add layers to the grid. Two types of layers are
currently supported. First is EventLayers in which each event is preserved as
an entry into the datastructure, even if no deposition occurs. If you are
interested in chronostratigraphy, this is probably what you are interested in.
Second is MaterialLayers, in which each layer must contain some material.
If an entire layer is eroded in MaterialLayers, the layer is removed.
MaterialLayers will likely use less memory than EventLayers.

Lithology
---------
Two objects based on the EventLayers object exist to make it easier to deal
with spatially variable lithology and associated properties. The Lithology
components contain information about spatially variable lithology and connect
with the Landlab model grid so that when rock is eroded or advected upward by
rock uplift the values of rock propeties at the topographic surface are updated.

First is the Lithology component which is a generic object for variable
lithology.

  .. toctree::
     :maxdepth: 4

     landlab.components.lithology

Second is LithoLayers which makes it easy to make layered rock.
