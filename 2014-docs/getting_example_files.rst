Getting Example Code Files
---------------------------

Depending on how you installed Landlab, you may not have access to any of the actual Landlab files, even though you can run the code.  All example models that are illustrated in this Landlab documentation are available for download in one zip file at https://github.com/landlab/drivers/archive/master.zip.

You can also get our example files by forking and cloning the Github repository to your machine (if you're comfortable with it). The files are at landlab/drivers.
