def setup_transition_list():
    """
    Creates and returns a list of Transition() objects to represent state
    transitions for a biased random walk, in which the rate of downward
    motion is greater than the rate in the other three directions.

    Returns
    -------
    xn_list : list of Transition objects
        List of objects that encode information about the link-state
        transitions.

    Notes
    -----
    This doesn't represent any particular process, but rather is simply used
    to test the CA code. The transition rules have 0-0 pairs transitioning to
    0-1 or 1-0 pairs (50/50 chance) and thence to 1-1 pairs, at which point
    there are no further transitions.

    The states and transitions are as follows::

        Pair state      Transition to       Process             Rate (cells/s)
        ==========      =============       =======             ==============
