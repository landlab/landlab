class ExponentialWeathererIntegrated(Component):

    """
    This component implements exponential weathering of bedrock on
    hillslopes. Uses exponential soil production function in the style
    of Ahnert (1976).

    Consider that ``w_0`` is the maximum soil production rate and
    that ``d_start`` is the characteristic soil production depth. The
    soil production rate ``w`` is given as a function of the soil
    depth ``d``::

        w = w_0 exp(-d / d_star)

    The :class:`~.ExponentialWeathererIntegrated` uses the analytical solution
    for the amount of soil produced by an exponential weathering
    function over a timestep dt, and returns both the thickness of
    bedrock weathered and the thickness of soil produced. The solution
    accounts for the reduction in rate over the timestep due to the
    increasing depth. This enables accuracy over arbitrarily large
    timesteps, and better compatiblity with the `run_one_step()`
    interface.

    Compared to :class:`~.ExponentialWeatherer`, upon which it is based...

    - This maintains the field I/O behavior of the original, but adds
      new return fields for the weathered thickness and soil produced
      thickness.
    - Density adjustments are needed inside the integral and the
      density ratio is intialized on instantiation. The default value
      of 1.0 assumes no change in density.
    - Returns both weathered depth of bedrock and produced depth of
      soil over the timestep.
    - The primary ``soil__depth`` field that is input is NOT updated by
      the component.

    This is left as an exercise for the model driver, as different
    applications may want to integrate soil depth and weathering in
    different sequences among other processes.

    - SHOULD maintain drop-in compatiblity with the plain
      :class:`~.ExponentialWeatherer`, just import and instantiate this one instead
      and existing code should work with no side effects other than the creation of the
      two additional (zeros) output fields.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from landlab import RasterModelGrid
    >>> from landlab.components import ExponentialWeathererIntegrated
    >>> mg = RasterModelGrid((5, 5))
    >>> soilz = mg.add_zeros("soil__depth", at="node")
    >>> soilrate = mg.add_ones("soil_production__rate", at="node")
    >>> expw = ExponentialWeathererIntegrated(mg)
    >>> dt = 1000
    >>> expw.run_one_step(dt)
    >>> np.allclose(mg.at_node['soil_production__rate'][mg.core_nodes], 1.)
    True
    >>> np.allclose(
    ...     mg.at_node['soil_production__dt_produced_depth'][mg.core_nodes], 6.9088
    ... )
    True
