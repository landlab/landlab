""" fire_test_series_example.py

This is a sample driver simply showing the histogram of fire recurrence
values drawn from the Weibull distribution.

This uses the default file in the generate_fire.py component. Because we are
drawing from a stochastic, statistical distribution, the output may change
after the component is reloaded.

The default file is currently set using parameters from central Colorado,
given by Cannon et al., (2008) and Moody and Martin (2001). This sample driver
should not be applied at other sites without careful consideration.
