""" uniform_precip_test.py

Sample driver file for the PrecipitationDistribution component.

This file will generate storm characteristics, update those characteristics,
and finally generate a storm time series across 100 years. After the storm
time series is generated, a plot will be drawn with storm intensity on the y-axis
and the storm duration along the x - axis.

Keep in mind - because these are drawn from a statistical distribution in
a stochastic manner, each run of this driver will differ from the last run.
