class SpatialPrecipitationDistribution(Component):
    """Generate spatially resolved precipitation events.

    A component to generate a sequence of spatially resolved storms over a
    grid, following a lightly modified version (see below) of the
    stochastic methods of Singer & Michaelides, Env Res Lett 12, 104011,
    2017, & Singer et al., Geosci. Model Dev., accepted, 10.5194/gmd-2018-86.

    The method is heavily stochastic, and at the present time is intimately
    calibrated against the conditions at Walnut Gulch, described in those
    papers. In particular, assumptions around intensity-duration
    calibration and orographic rainfall are "burned in" for now, and are
    not accessible to the user. The various probability distributions
    supplied to the various run methods default to WG values, but are
    easily modified.  This calibration reflects a US desert southwest
    "monsoonal" climate, and the component distinguishes (optionally)
    between two seasons, "monsoonal" and "winter". The intensity-duration
    relationship is shared between the seasons, and so may prove useful in
    a variety of storm-dominated contexts.

    The default is to disable the orographic rainfall functionality of the
    component. However, if orographic_scenario == 'Singer', the component
    requires a 'topographic__elevation' field to already exist on the grid
    at the time of instantiation.

    The component has two ways of simulating a "year". This choice is
    controlled by the 'limit' parameter of the yield methods. If limit==
    'total_rainfall', the component will continue to run until the total
    rainfall for the season and/or year exceeds a stochastically generated
    value. This method is directly comparable to the Singer & Michaelides
    method, but will almost always result in years which are not one
    calendar year long, unless the input distributions are very carefully
    recalibrated for each use case. If limit=='total_time', the component
    will terminate a season and/or year once the elapsed time exceeds one
    year. In this case, the total rainfall will not correspond to the
    stochastically generated total. You can access the actual total for the
    last season using the property `(median_)total_rainfall_last_season`.

    Note that this component cannot simulate the occurrence of more than one
    storm at the same time. Storms that should be synchronous will instead
    occur sequentially, with no interstorm time. This limitation means that
    if enough storms occur in a year that numstorms*mean_storm_duration
    exceeds one year, the number of simulated storms will saturate. This
    limitation may be relaxed in the future.

    The component offers the option to modify the maximum number of storms
    simulated per year. If you find simulations encountering this limit too
    often, you may need to raise this limit. Conversely, it could be lowered
    to reduce memory usage over small grids. However, in increasing the value,
    beware - the component maintains two limit*nnodes arrays, which will chew
    through memory if the limit gets too high. The default will happily
    simulate grids up to around 50 km * 50 km using the default probability
    distributions.

    Key methods are:
    yield_storms
        Generate a timeseries of storm:interstorm duration pairs, alongside
        a field that describes the spatial distribution of rain during that
        storm.
    yield_years
        Generate a timeseries of ints giving number of storms per year,
        alongside a field that describes the spatial distribution of total
        rainfall across that year.
    yield_seasons
        Generate a timeseries of ints giving number of storms per season,
        alongside a field that describes the spatial distribution of total
        rainfall across that season.
    calc_annual_rainfall
        Produce a timeseries of tuples giving total rainfall each season,
        without resolving the storms spatially (i.e., fast!).

    A large number of properties are available to access storm properties
    during generation:
    - current_year
    - current_season
    - storm_depth_last_storm
    - storm_recession_value_last_storm
    - storm_duration_last_storm
    - storm_area_last_storm
    - storm_intensity_last_storm
    - total_rainfall_this_season
    - total_rainfall_this_year
    - total_rainfall_last_season
    - total_rainfall_last_year
    - median_total_rainfall_this_season
    - median_total_rainfall_this_year
    - median_total_rainfall_last_season
    - median_total_rainfall_last_year
    - number_of_nodes_under_storm
    - nodes_under_storm
    - target_median_total_rainfall_this_season

    Note that becuase these are medians not means,
    median_total_rainfall_last_season + median_total_rainfall_this_season
    != median_total_rainfall_this_year.

    Significant differences between this component and the Singer code are:
    - The component does not model evapotranspiration. Use a separate
        Landlab component for this.
    - The component runs only over a LL grid; there is no such thing as a
        validation or simulation run.
    - It produces "fuzz" around intensity values using a continuous
        distribution; Singer does this with integer steps.
    - Step changes mid-run cannot be explicitly modelled. Instead, run the
        component for a fixed duration, make the change to the
        distribution input parameter, then run it again.
    - Storms can be centred at any spatial coordinate, not just over nodes.
    - Edge buffering is now dynamic; i.e., big storms have a bigger edge
        buffer than smaller storms. Storms can be centered off the grid
        edges.
    - Storms are never discarded - once a storm is drawn, it must hit the
        catchment, and positions are repeatedly selected until this can
        happen. Singer's method would discard such a storm and draw a new
        one.
    - Durations are not rescaled to ensure both total duration and total
        precip are both satisfied at the same time, as in Singer's method.
        Instead, the component either matches a year's duration, *or*
        exactly a year's worth of rain. This choice is dictated by the
        `limit` parameter in the yield methods.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from landlab import RasterModelGrid, VoronoiDelaunayGrid
    >>> mg = RasterModelGrid((10, 10), xy_spacing=1000.)
    >>> rain = SpatialPrecipitationDistribution(mg)

    Calling yield_storms will produce storm-interstorm duration (hr) pairs
    until the model runtime has elapsed.

    >>> np.random.seed(1)
    >>> total_t_each_step = [
    ...     (storm+interstorm) for (storm, interstorm) in rain.yield_storms()]
    >>> len(total_t_each_step)
    41
    >>> np.isclose(sum(total_t_each_step)/24., 365.)
    True

    The actual rainfall intensities during that interval are accessible in the
    'rainfall__flux' field (mm/hr). The storm centre does not have to be over
    the grid, but in this case, it was for the last simulated storm:

    >>> mg.at_node['rainfall__flux'].argmax()
    80

    We can also run the component for only one season (i.e., only using one
    of the pdf sets describing the storm properties):

    >>> for field in ('rainfall__flux', 'rainfall__total_depth_per_year'):
    ...     _ = mg.at_node.pop(field)  # clear out the existing fields
    >>> rain = SpatialPrecipitationDistribution(mg, number_of_years=2)
    >>> np.random.seed(5)
    >>> total_t_each_step = [
    ...     (storm+interstorm) for (storm, interstorm) in rain.yield_storms(
    ...         style='monsoonal', monsoon_fraction_of_year=0.35)]
    >>> np.isclose(sum(total_t_each_step)/24./365./2., 0.35)
    True

    Note this behaviour can be stopped by upping monsoon_fraction_of_year:

    >>> np.random.seed(5)
    >>> total_t_each_step = [
    ...     (storm+interstorm) for (storm, interstorm) in rain.yield_storms(
    ...         style='monsoonal', monsoon_fraction_of_year=1.)]
    >>> np.isclose(round(sum(total_t_each_step)/24./365./2., 2), 1.)
    True

    yield_years yields the number of storms in the last whole year.
    Use 'rainfall__total_depth_per_year' to access the rainfall map for the
    last fully elapsed year, or equivalently, the total_rainfall_last_year
    property. Note the component seamlessly handles non-raster grid types:

    >>> vdg = VoronoiDelaunayGrid(np.random.rand(100)*1000.,
    ...                           np.random.rand(100)*1000.)
    >>> np.random.seed(3)
    >>> rain = SpatialPrecipitationDistribution(vdg, number_of_years=3)
    >>> storms_each_year = []
    >>> for total_storms in rain.yield_years(style='monsoonal',
    ...                                      total_rf_trend=0.05,
    ...                                      storminess_trend=-0.02):
    ...     storms_each_year.append(total_storms)
    ...     assert(np.all(np.equal(
    ...         vdg.at_node['rainfall__total_depth_per_year'],
    ...         rain.total_rainfall_last_year)))
    >>> sum(storms_each_year)
    11

    yield_seasons yields rainfall statistics for individual seasons. Access
    these using the various provided component properties. Note that we can
    get the component to yield a total rainfall that is calibrated to the
    supplied total_rf_gaussians if we set limit to 'total__rainfall' rather
    than 'total_time' (at the cost of exactly matching the season length):

    >>> for field in ('rainfall__flux', 'rainfall__total_depth_per_year'):
    ...     _ = mg.at_node.pop(field)  # clear out the existing fields
    >>> rain = SpatialPrecipitationDistribution(mg, number_of_years=2)
    >>> np.random.seed(5)
    >>> season_list = []
    >>> theoretical_median_rf_season = []
    >>> median_rf_season = []
    >>> median_rf_last_year = []
    >>> mean_rf_season = []
    >>> mean_rf_last_year = []
    >>> for storm_number in rain.yield_seasons(limit='total_rainfall'):
    ...     season_list.append(rain.current_season)
    ...     theoretical_median_rf_season.append(
    ...         rain.target_median_total_rainfall_this_season)
    ...     median_rf_season.append(rain.median_total_rainfall_this_season)
    ...     median_rf_last_year.append(rain.median_total_rainfall_last_year)
    ...     mean_rf_season.append(rain.total_rainfall_this_season.mean())
    ...     mean_rf_last_year.append(rain.total_rainfall_last_year.mean())
    >>> season_list == ['M', 'W', 'M', 'W']
    True
    >>> [meas > sim for (meas, sim) in zip(
    ...     median_rf_season, theoretical_median_rf_season)]  # must exceed
    [True, True, True, True]
    >>> np.isclose(median_rf_last_year[0], 0.)
    True
    >>> for season in (0, 2):  # this property must be the same in both seasons
    ...     np.isclose(median_rf_last_year[season],
    ...                median_rf_last_year[season + 1])
    True
    True

    Note that because we work here with medians, the seasonal medians don't sum
    to the year median, but the means do:

    >>> np.isclose(median_rf_last_year[2],
    ...            median_rf_season[0] + median_rf_season[1])
    False
    >>> np.isclose(mean_rf_last_year[2],
    ...            mean_rf_season[0] + mean_rf_season[1])
    True

        Yield a timeseries giving the number if storms occurring each year in
        a rainfall simulation.

        All default distributions specified as parameters reflect values for
        Walnut Gulch, see Singer & Michaelides, 2017 & Singer et al, submitted.

        Parameters
        ----------
        limit : ('total_time', 'total_rainfall')
            Controls whether a season is defined based on its total rainfall
            (and can be any length), or by its duration (and can have any
            amount of rainfall). If 'total_time', monsoon_fraction_of_year
            sets the fraction of a year occupied by the monsoon.
        style : ('whole_year', 'monsoonal', 'winter')
            Controls whether the component seeks to simulate a western US-
            style "monsoonal" climate, a western US-style winter climate,
            or a full year combining both. These distributions are by default
            based on Singer et al.'s calibrations. Note if 'monsoonal',
            the total duration of a "year" will appear to be only
            `monsoon_fraction_of_year`, and the opposite for `winter`.
        total_rf_trend : float
            Controls if a drift is applied to the total rainfall distribution
            through time. If 0., no trend. If positive, rainfall totals
            increase gradually through time. If negative, they fall through
            time. S&M recommend +/- 0.07 for a realistic climate change driven
            drift at Walnut Gulch.
        storminess_trend : float
            Controls if a drift is applied to the expected intensity of
            individual storms through time. If 0., no trend. If positive,
            storms get more intense through time, if negative, less so. S&M
            recommend +/- 0.01 for a realistic climate change driven drift at
            Walnut Gulch.
        monsoon_fraction_of_year : float
            If limit == 'total_time', sets the fraction of one year occupied
            by the monsoon season. If not, ignored. Singer's monsoon runs from
            May to September, inclusive, and the default reflects this.

       monsoon_total_rf_gaussian is a normal distribution controlling the total
            rainfall expected in each year. S&M use 'mu' in {143., 271.} for
            step changes up/down in rainfall totals.
        monsoon_storm_duration_GEV is a generalised extreme value distribution
            controlling the duration of each storm. In MIN.
        monsoon_storm_area_GEV is a generalised extreme value distribution
            controlling the plan view area of each storm. S&M use 'shape': 0.,
            which collapses the distribution to a plain extreme value
            distribution.
        monsoon_storm_interarrival_GEV is a generalised extreme value
            distribution controlling the interarrival time between each storm.
            In HRS. Note that this calibration is specifically to Walnut Gulch,
            which has an area of 275 km**2. The generator directly scales this

            Tuple pair of duration of a single storm, then the interstorm
            interval that follows it. In hrs. The rainfall__flux field
            describes the rainfall rate during the interval storm_t as the
            tuple is yielded. In HRS.
            Note that the rainfall__total_depth_per_year field gives the total
            accumulated rainfall depth during the *last completed* model year,
            not the year to the point of yield. For the latter, use the
            property `total_rainfall_this_year`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        limit : ('total_time', 'total_rainfall')
            Controls whether a season is defined based on its total rainfall
            (and can be any length), or by its duration (and can have any
            amount of rainfall). If 'total_time', monsoon_fraction_of_year
            sets the fraction of a year occupied by the monsoon.
        style : ('whole_year', 'monsoonal', 'winter')
            Controls whether the component seeks to simulate a western US-
            style "monsoonal" climate, a western US-style winter climate,
            or a full year combining both. These distributions are by default
            based on Singer et al.'s calibrations. Note if 'monsoonal',
            the total duration of a "year" will appear to be only
            `monsoon_fraction_of_year`, and the opposite for `winter`.
        total_rf_trend : float
            Controls if a drift is applied to the total rainfall distribution
            through time. If 0., no trend. If positive, rainfall totals
            increase gradually through time. If negative, they fall through
            time. S&M recommend +/- 0.07 for a realistic climate chage driven
            drift at Walnut Gulch.
        storminess_trend : float
            Controls if a drift is applied to the expected intensity of
            individual storms through time. If 0., no trend. If positive,
            storms get more intense through time, if negative, less so. S&M
            recommend +/- 0.01 for a realistic climate change driven drift at
            Walnut Gulch.
        monsoon_fraction_of_year : float
            If limit == 'total_time', sets the fraction of one year occupied
            by the monsoon season. If not, ignored. Singer's monsoon runs from
            May to September, inclusive, and the default reflects this.

            distribution controlling the interarrival time between each storm.
            In HRS. Note that this calibration is specifically to Walnut Gulch,
            which has an area of 275 km**2. The generator directly scales this

            distribution controlling the interarrival time between each storm.
            In HRS. The same considerations apply here as for the monsoonal
            interstorm equivalent.
        winter_storm_radial_weakening_gaussian is a normal distribution
            controlling the rate of intensity decline with distance from storm
            center. For more detail see Rodriguez-Iturbe et al., 1986; Morin
            et al., 2005.

        Yields

        number_of_storms_per_season : float
            Float that gives the number of storms simulated in the season that
            elapsed since the last yield. The rainfall__total_depth_per_year
            field gives the total accumulated rainfall depth during the *year*
            preceding the yield, *so far*. rainfall__flux gives the rainfall
            intensity of the last storm in that year.
        NB: Use the component property total_rainfall_last_season to access
            the *actual* amount of rainfall in the season that has the number
            of storms that the method generates.

        This is the underlying process that runs the component, but it should
        be run by a user through the yield_storms and yield_years methods.

        Fuzz to the chosen values is now selected from a continuous
        distribution, not from integer values.

        total_rf_trend controls if a drift is applied to the total rainfall
        distribution through time. If 0., no trend. If positive, rainfall
        totals increase gradually through time. If negative, they fall through
        time. S&M recommend +/- 0.07 for a realistic climate chage driven drift
        at Walnut Gulch.

        storminess_trend controls if a drift is applied to the expected
        intensity of individual storms through time. If 0., no trend. If
        positive, storms get more intense through time, if negative, less so.
        S&M recommend +/- 0.01 for a realistic climate change driven drift at
        Walnut Gulch.

        All default distributions reflect values for Walnut Gulch, see Singer &
        Michaelides, submitted:

        monsoon_total_rf_gaussian is a normal distribution controlling the
            total rainfall expected in each year. S&M use 'mu' in {143., 271.}
            for step changes up/down in rainfall totals. In mm.
        monsoon_storm_duration_GEV is a generalised extreme value distribution
            controlling the duration of each storm. In MIN.
        monsoon_storm_area_GEV is a generalised extreme value distribution
            controlling the plan view area of each storm. S&M use 'shape': 0.,
            which collapses the distribution to a plain extreme value
            distribution.
        monsoon_storm_interarrival_GEV is a generalised extreme value
            distribution controlling the interarrival time between each storm.
            In HRS. Note that this calibration is specifically to Walnut Gulch,
            which has an area of 275 km**2. The generator directly scales this
            resulting distribution to the area ratio of Walnut Gulch to the
            open cells of the grid. This crudely accounts for the fact that
            bigger catchments will have more storms, but note that the heavy
            tail on this distribution means the default distribution shape
            will not be trustworthy for catchments with big differences in
            size from Walnut Gulch.
        monsoon_storm_radial_weakening_gaussian is a normal distribution

            et al., 2005.
        winter_total_rf_gaussian is a normal distribution controlling the total
            rainfall expected in each year. S&M use 'mu' in {143., 271.} for
            step changes up/down in rainfall totals.
        winter_storm_duration_fisk is a Fisk (i.e., log-logistic) distribution
            controlling the duration of each storm. Note this differs from the
            summer scaling. In MIN.
        winter_storm_area_GEV is a generalised extreme value distribution
            controlling the plan view area of each storm. S&M use 'shape': 0.,
            which collapses the distribution to a plain extreme value
