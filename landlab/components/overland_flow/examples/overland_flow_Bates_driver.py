Last updated April 20, 2016.

Simple driver showing how to use the Bates' overland flow component in Landlab.
This driver sets up their test case from de Almeida et al., 2012, where output
from the Bates et al., 2010 algorithm is compared to the analytical solution.

This is a componentized version of the driver example
