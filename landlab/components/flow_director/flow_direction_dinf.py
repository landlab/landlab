    Find Dinfinity flow directions and proportions on a raster grid.

    Finds and returns flow directions and proportions for a given elevation
    grid by the D infinity method (Tarboton, 1997). Each node is assigned two
    flow directions, toward the two neighboring nodes that are on the steepest
    subtriangle. Partitioning of flow is done based on the aspect of the
    subtriangle.

    This method does not support irregular grids.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid : ModelGrid
        A grid of type Voroni.
    elevs : field name at node or array of length node
        The surface to direct flow across.
    baselevel_nodes : array_like, optional
        IDs of open boundary (baselevel) nodes.

    Returns
    -------
    receivers : ndarray of size (num nodes, max neighbors at node)
        For each node, the IDs of the nodes that receive its flow. For nodes
        that do not direct flow to all neighbors, BAD_INDEX_VALUE is given as
        a placeholder. The ID of the node itself is given if no other receiver
        is assigned.
    proportions : ndarray of size (num nodes, max neighbors at node)
        For each receiver, the proportion of flow (between 0 and 1) is given.
        A proportion of zero indicates that the link does not have flow along
        it.
    steepest_slope : ndarray
        The slope value (positive downhill) in the direction of flow.
    steepest_receiver : ndarray
        For each node, the node ID of the node connected by the steepest link.
        BAD_INDEX_VALUE is given if no flow emmanates from the node.
    sink : ndarray
        IDs of nodes that are flow sinks (they are their own receivers)
    receiver_links : ndarray of size (num nodes, max neighbors at node)
        ID of links that leads from each node to its receiver, or
        UNDEFINED_INDEX if no flow occurs on this link.
    steepest_link : ndarray
        For each node, the link ID of the steepest link.
        BAD_INDEX_VALUE is given if no flow emmanates from the node.
