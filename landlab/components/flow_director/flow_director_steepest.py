    Examples
    --------

    This method works for both raster and irregular grids. First we will look
    at a raster example, and then an irregular example.

    >>> fd_2.run_one_step()

            8, 10,  6, 11,
           12, 14, 10, 15,
           16, 17, 18, 19])

    And the at-link field ``'flow__link_direction'`` indicates if the flow along
    the link is with or against the direction indicated by ``'link_dirs_at_node'``
    (from tail node to head node).

    >>> mg_2.at_link['flow__link_direction']
    array([ 0,  0,  0,  0, -1, -1,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, -1,  0,  0,  1,  0,
        0,  0, -1,  0,  0,  1,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0], dtype=int8)

    This indicates that flow on links 4, 5, 12, and 19 goes against the
    topologic ordering -- that is that flow goes from head node to tail node --
    and that flow goes with the topologic ordering on links 15 and 22. All other
    links have no flow on them.

    The FlowDirectorSteepest attribute ``flow_link_direction_at_node`` indicates
    the link flow direction (with or against topology directions) for all links
    at node. The ordering of links at node mirrors the grid attribute
    ``links_at_node``.

    >>> fd_2.flow_link_direction_at_node()
    array([[ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0, -1,  0,  0],
           [ 0, -1,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  0, -1],
           [ 0, -1,  0, -1],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 1,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0, -1,  1, -1],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 1,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  1, -1],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0]], dtype=int8)

    For example, this indicates that node 10 has flow going along three links
    that are attached to it. The link to the East has no flow, the link to the
    North has flow going against the topologic direction, the link to the West
    has flow going with the topologic direction, and the link to the South has
    flow going against the topologic direction.

    In many use cases, one might want to know which links are bringing flow into
    or out of the node. The flow director attribute ``flow_link_incoming_at_node``
    provides this information. Here -1 means that flow is outgoing from the node
    and 1 means it is incoming.

    >>> fd_2.flow_link_incoming_at_node()
    array([[ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  1,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  1,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  0, -1],
           [ 0,  1,  0, -1],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [-1,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  1,  1, -1],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [-1,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  1, -1],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  0,  0]], dtype=int8)

    So if one wanted to identify the source nodes at node, you would do the
    following:

    >>> np.where(fd_2.flow_link_incoming_at_node() == 1, mg_2.adjacent_nodes_at_node, -1)
    array([[-1, -1, -1, -1],
           [-1,  5, -1, -1],
           [-1,  6, -1, -1],
           [-1, -1, -1, -1],
           [-1, -1, -1, -1],
           [-1, -1, -1, -1],
           [-1, 10, -1, -1],
           [-1, -1, -1, -1],
           [-1, -1, -1, -1],
           [-1, -1, -1, -1],
           [-1, 14,  9, -1],
           [-1, -1, -1, -1],
           [-1, -1, -1, -1],
           [-1, -1, -1, -1],
           [-1, -1, 13, -1],
           [-1, -1, -1, -1],
           [-1, -1, -1, -1],
           [-1, -1, -1, -1],
           [-1, -1, -1, -1],
           [-1, -1, -1, -1]])

    The flow directors also have the ability to return the flow receiver nodes

    >>> receiver = fd.direct_flow()
    >>> receiver
    array([0, 1, 2,
           3, 1, 5,
           6, 7, 8])

    For the second example we will use a Hexagonal Model Grid, a special type
    of Voroni Grid that has regularly spaced hexagonal cells.

    >>> from landlab import HexModelGrid
    >>> mg = HexModelGrid((5, 3))
    >>> _ = mg.add_field(
    ...     "topographic__elevation",
    ...     mg.node_x + np.round(mg.node_y),
    ...     at="node",
    ... )
    >>> fd = FlowDirectorSteepest(mg, 'topographic__elevation')
    >>> fd.surface_values
    array([ 1. ,  2. ,  3. ,
        1.5,  2.5,  3.5,  4.5,

        3.5,  4.5,  5.5,  6.5,
            4. ,  5. ,  6. ])
    >>> fd.run_one_step()
    >>> mg.at_node['flow__receiver_node']
    array([ 0,  1,  2,
          3,  0,  1,  6,
        7,  3,  4,  5,  11,

        This property mirrors links_at_node and indicates the relationship
        between the flow direction (determined based on the elevation of nodes)
        and the topologic link direction (in which the head and tail nodes are
        defined based on relative position in x-y space).

        It has the shape (number of nodes, maximum number of links at node).

        Recall that the standard landlab link direction goes from the tail node
        to the head node.

        A value of zero indicates that the link does not exist or is not
        active.

        A value of -1 indicates that water flow based on
        ``flow__link_to_receiver_node`` goes from head node to tail node, while
        a value of 1 indicates that water flow goes from tail node to head
        node.
