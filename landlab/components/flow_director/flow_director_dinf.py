class FlowDirectorDINF(_FlowDirectorToMany):

    """
    Flow direction on a raster grid by the D infinity method.

    Directs flow by the D infinity method (Tarboton, 1997). Each node is
    assigned two flow directions, toward the two neighboring nodes that are on
    the steepest subtriangle. Partitioning of flow is done based on the aspect
    of the subtriangle.

    Specifically, it stores as ModelGrid fields:

    -  Node array of receivers (nodes that receive flow), or ITS OWN ID if
       there is no receiver: *'flow__receiver_nodes'*. This array is 2D, and is
       of dimension (number of nodes x max number of receivers).
    -  Node array of flow proportions: *'flow__receiver_proportions'*. This
       array is 2D, and is of dimension (number of nodes x max number of
       receivers).
    -  Node array of links carrying flow:  *'flow__links_to_receiver_nodes'*.
       This array is 2D, and is of dimension (number of nodes x max number of
       receivers).
    -  Node array of the steepest downhill receiver. *'flow__receiver_nodes'*
    -  Node array of steepest downhill slope from each receiver:
       *'topographic__steepest_slope'*
    -  Node array containing ID of steepest link that leads from each node to a
       receiver, or BAD_INDEX_VALUE if no link:
       *'flow__link_to_receiver_node'*
    -  Boolean node array of all local lows: *'flow__sink_flag'*

    The primary method of this class is :func:`run_one_step`.

    Construction::

        FlowDirectorDINF(grid, surface='topographic__elevation')

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid : ModelGrid
        A grid.
    surface : field name at node or array of length node, optional
        The surface to direct flow across, default is field at node:
        topographic__self.surface_valuesation.
    partition_method: string, optional
        Method for partitioning flow. Options include 'slope' (default) and
        'square_root_of_slope'.

    Examples
    --------

    This method works for both raster and irregular grids. First we will look
    at a raster example, and then an irregular example.

    >>> import numpy as numpy
    >>> from landlab import RasterModelGrid
    >>> from landlab.components import FlowDirectorDINF
    >>> mg = RasterModelGrid((4,4), spacing=(1, 1))
    >>> mg.set_closed_boundaries_at_grid_edges(True, True, True, False)
    >>> _ = mg.add_field('topographic__elevation',
    ...                  mg.node_x**2 + mg.node_y**2,
    ...                  at = 'node')

    The DINF flow director can be uses for raster grids only.

    >>> fd = FlowDirectorDINF(mg, 'topographic__elevation')
    >>> fd.surface_values.reshape(mg.shape)
    array([[  0.,   1.,   4.,   9.],
           [  1.,   2.,   5.,  10.],
           [  4.,   5.,   8.,  13.],
           [  9.,  10.,  13.,  18.]])
    >>> fd.run_one_step()

    Unlike flow directors that only direct flow to one node or to all
    downstream nodes, FlowDirectorDINF directs flow two nodes only. It stores
    the receiver information is a (number of nodes x 2) shape field at nodes.

    >>> mg.at_node['flow__receiver_nodes']
    array([[ 0, -1],
           [ 1, -1],
           [ 2, -1],
           [ 3, -1],
           [ 0,  1],
           [ 1,  0],
           [ 5,  1],
           [ 6,  2],
           [ 8, -1],
           [ 5, -1],
           [ 6,  5],
           [10,  6],
           [12, -1],
           [ 9, -1],
           [10,  9],
           [-1, 10]])

    It also stores the proportions of flow going to each receiver and the link
    on which the flow moves in at node arrays.

    >>> mg.at_node['flow__receiver_proportions'] # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    array([[ 1.        ,  0.        ],

           [18, 36],
           [19, 38],
           [20, 40]])

    Like flow directors that only direct flow to one downstream node,
    FlowDirectorDINF identifies and stores the steepest slope leading downhill
    from each node, the link carrying that flow, and the receiver receiving
    flow on that link.

            1.41421356,  3.        ,  5.        ,  0.        ,  3.        ,
            4.24264069,  5.65685425,  0.        ,  5.        ,  5.65685425,
            7.07106781])
    >>> mg.at_node['flow__link_to_receiver_node']
    array([-1,  0,  1,  2,  3, 24,  8,  9, -1, 11, 32, 34, -1, 18, 38, 40])
    >>> mg.at_node['flow__receiver_node']
    array([ 0,  0,  1,  2,  0,  0,  5,  6,  8,  5,  5,  6, 12,  9,  9, 10])

    Finally, FlowDirectorDINF identifies sinks, or local lows.

    >>> mg.at_node['flow__sink_flag']
    array([1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], dtype=int8)

    The flow directors also have the ability to return the flow receiver nodes
    through a function called direct_flow()

    >>> fd = FlowDirectorDINF(mg, 'topographic__elevation')
    >>> fd.run_one_step()
    >>> receivers, proportions = fd.direct_flow()
    >>> receivers
    array([[ 0, -1],
           [ 1, -1],

           [ 6,  5],
           [10,  6],
           [12, -1],
           [ 9, -1],
           [10,  9],
           [-1, 10]])
    >>> proportions # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    array([[ 1.        ,  0.        ],

           [ 1.        ,  0.        ],
           [ 1.        ,  0.        ],
           [ 0.        ,  1.        ],
           [ 0.59033447,  0.40966553],
           [ 0.74866817,  0.25133183],
           [ 1.        ,  0.        ],
           [ 1.        ,  0.        ],
           [ 0.        ,  1.        ],

           [ 0.        ,  1.        ]])

    one.
