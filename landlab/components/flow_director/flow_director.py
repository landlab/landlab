the boundary condition testing.

    Private class for creating components to calculate flow directions.

    This class is not meant to be used directly in modeling efforts.
    Instead it has the functionality that all flow direction calculators need
    to initialize and check boundary conditions.

    The primary method of this class, :func:`run_one_step` is not implemented.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid : ModelGrid
        A grid.
    surface : field name at node or array of length node
        The surface to direct flow across.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from landlab import RasterModelGrid
    >>> from landlab.components.flow_director.flow_director import(
    ... _FlowDirector)
    >>> mg = RasterModelGrid((3,3), spacing=(1, 1))
    >>> mg.set_closed_boundaries_at_grid_edges(True, True, True, False)
    >>> _ = mg.add_field('topographic__elevation',
