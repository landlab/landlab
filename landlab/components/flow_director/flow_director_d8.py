flow_director_d8.py: provides the component FlowDirectorsD8.

This components finds the steepest single-path steepest descent flow
directions and considers diagonal links between nodes on a raster grid. It is
not implemented for irregular grids. For a method that works for irregular
grids and does not consider diagonal links for rasters, use
FlowDirectorSteepest instead.

class FlowDirectorD8(_FlowDirectorToOne):

    """Single-path (steepest direction) flow direction with diagonals on
    rasters.

    Single-path (steepest direction) flow direction finding on raster grids
    by the D8 method. This method considers flow on all eight links such that
    flow is possible on orthogonal and on diagonal links.

    The method that considers only orthogonal links (D4 method) for raster
    grids is FlowDirectorSteepest.

    This method is not implemented for Voroni grids, use
    FlowDirectorSteepest instead.

    Stores as ModelGrid fields:

    -  Node array of receivers (nodes that receive flow), or ITS OWN ID if
       there is no receiver: *'flow__receiver_node'*
    -  Node array of steepest downhill slopes:
       *'topographic__steepest_slope'*
    -  Node array containing ID of link that leads from each node to its
       receiver, or BAD_INDEX_VALUE if no link:
       *'flow__link_to_receiver_node'*
    -  Boolean node array of all local lows: *'flow__sink_flag'*

    The primary method of this class is :func:`run_one_step`.
