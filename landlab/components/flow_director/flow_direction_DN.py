def grid_flow_directions(grid, elevations):

    """
    Flow directions on raster grid.

    Calculate flow directions for node elevations on a raster grid.
    Each node is assigned a single direction, toward one of its neighboring
    nodes (or itself, if none of its neighbors are lower). There is only
    flow from one node to another if there is a negative gradient. If a
    node's steepest gradient is >= 0., then its slope is set to zero and
    its receiver node is listed as itself.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid : RasterModelGrid
        a raster grid.
    elevations: ndarray
        Node elevations.

    Returns
    -------
    receiver : (ncells, ) ndarray
        For each cell, the node in the direction of steepest descent, or
        itself if no downstream nodes.
    steepest_slope : (ncells, ) ndarray
        The slope value in the steepest direction of flow.

    Notes
    -----
    This function considers only nodes that have four neighbors. Thus, only
    calculate flow directions and slopes for nodes that have associated
    cells.

    Examples
    --------
    This example calculates flow routing on a (4,5) raster grid with the
    following node elevations::

        5 - 5 - 5 - 5 - 5
        |   |   |   |   |
        5 - 3 - 4 - 3 - 5
        |   |   |   |   |
        5 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 5
        |   |   |   |   |
        5 - 0 - 5 - 5 - 5

    """
    Find flow directions on a grid.

    Finds and returns flow directions for a given elevation grid. Each node is
    assigned a single direction, toward one of its N neighboring nodes (or
    itself, if none of its neighbors are lower).

    Parameters
    ----------
    elev : array_like
        Elevations at nodes.
    active_links : array_like
        IDs of active links.
    tail_node : array_like
        IDs of the tail node for each link.
    head_node : array_like
        IDs of the head node for each link.
    link_slope : array_like
        slope of each link, defined POSITIVE DOWNHILL (i.e., a negative value
        means the link runs uphill from the fromnode to the tonode).
    baselevel_nodes : array_like, optional
        IDs of open boundary (baselevel) nodes.

    Returns
    -------
    receiver : ndarray
        For each node, the ID of the node that receives its flow. Defaults to
        the node itself if no other receiver is assigned.
    steepest_slope : ndarray
        The slope value (positive downhill) in the direction of flow
    sink : ndarray
        IDs of nodes that are flow sinks (they are their own receivers)
    receiver_link : ndarray
        ID of link that leads from each node to its receiver, or
        UNDEFINED_INDEX if none.

    Examples
    --------
    The example below assigns elevations to the 10-node example network in
    Braun and Willett (2012), so that their original flow pattern should be
    re-created.

    >>> tn = np.array([4,5,7,1,2,5,6,5,7,7,8,9,9,8,8,6,3,3])
    >>> s = z[fn] - z[tn]  # slope with unit link length, positive downhill
    >>> active_links = np.arange(len(fn))
    >>> r, ss, snk, rl = flow_directions(z, active_links, fn, tn, s)
    >>> r
    array([1, 4, 1, 6, 4, 4, 5, 4, 6, 7])
    >>> ss
    array([ 1.4,  1. ,  1.2,  1. ,  0. ,  1.1,  0.9,  2.3,  1.1,  0.9])
    >>> snk
    array([4])
    >>> rl[3:8]
    array([15, -1,  1,  6,  2])

    OK, the following are rough notes on design: we want to work with just the
    active links. Ways to do this:
    *  Pass active_links in as argument
    *  In calling code, only refer to receiver_links for active nodes
