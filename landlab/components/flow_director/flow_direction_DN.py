    """Find flow directions on a grid.

    Finds and returns flow directions for a given elevation grid. Each node is
    assigned a single direction, toward one of its N neighboring nodes (or
    itself, if none of its neighbors are lower).

    Parameters
    ----------
    elev : array_like
        Elevations at nodes.
    active_links : array_like
        IDs of active links.
    tail_node : array_like
        IDs of the tail node for each link.
    head_node : array_like
        IDs of the head node for each link.
    link_slope : array_like
        slope of each link, defined POSITIVE DOWNHILL (i.e., a negative value
        means the link runs uphill from the fromnode to the tonode).
    baselevel_nodes : array_like, optional
        IDs of open boundary (baselevel) nodes.

    Returns
    -------
    receiver : ndarray
        For each node, the ID of the node that receives its flow. Defaults to
        the node itself if no other receiver is assigned.
    steepest_slope : ndarray
        The slope value (positive downhill) in the direction of flow
    sink : ndarray
        IDs of nodes that are flow sinks (they are their own receivers)
    receiver_link : ndarray
        ID of link that leads from each node to its receiver, or
        UNDEFINED_INDEX if none.

    Examples
    --------
    The example below assigns elevations to the 10-node example network in
    Braun and Willett (2012), so that their original flow pattern should be
    re-created.
