class ZoneTaxon(Taxon):
    """A taxon based in zones.

    A ``ZoneTaxon`` is composed of members of a lower taxonomic level that each
    exists within a ``Zone`` object. Taxonomic rank is not considered by this
    class despite the use of the term, 'speciation', which is used herein to
    generally describe creation of a child taxon object.

    All zones of the taxon can be obtained with the attribute, ``zones`` that
    are the objects that manage the geographic aspect of taxon member
    populations. The total geographic extent of all populations is depicted by
    the ``range_mask`` attribute. The zones of a ZoneTaxon instance are created
    and updated using a ``ZoneController``. At model time steps, the
    connectivity of zones over time is obtained using attributes of the
    ``Zone`` object.

    The evolution of this taxon type is carried out in two stages during a
    model time step. In the first stage, the zones of the taxon are updated
    as the result of zone connectivity between the prior and current step in
    the method, ``_update_zones``. This method is the primary implementation of
    taxon dispersal and it is called in a stage prior to other evolutionary
    processes so that all taxa are positioned in their landscape locations
    prior to the other processes.

    In the second stage, processes are carried out in methods that are readily
    expanded or overridden when needed. The primary methods of second stage
    macroevolution are ``_evaluate_dispersal``, ``_evaluate_speciation``, and
    ``_evaluate_extinction``. The evaluate dispersal method is intended to
    modify dispersal conducted in the first stage and it has no effect unless
    it is expanded or overridden to have an effect. Processes other than those
    listed above can be called by expanding or overridding the ``_evolve``
    method.

    The taxon is allopatric when it is associated with/exists within multiple
    zones (signifying multiple member populations). A timer is started when a
    taxon becomes allopatric. Allopatric speciation occurs once the timer
    reaches or exceeds the ``time_to_allopatric_speciation`` initialization
    parameter. If the initialization parameter, ``persists_post_speciation``
    is True (default), a child taxon is created in each zone except one zone
    (the largest by area) that becomes the sole zone of the taxon. If
    ``persists_post_speciation`` is set to False, a child taxon is created in
    each and every zone, and the parent no longer occupies any zones, and
    therefore the parent taxon is no longer extant.

    Extinction occurs when the taxon is no longer associated with any zones.
    This occurs when zones in the prior time step do not overlap zones in the
    current time step, signifying the geographic range of the taxon is no more.
    A taxon can become no longer extant also when the taxon speciates and
    ``persists_post_speciation`` is False signifying that the parent taxon
    has evolved into multiple taxon distinct from the original taxon.

    The following columns will be added to the ``record_data_frame`` of the
    SpeciesEvolver instance that tracks objects of this Taxon: 'speciations'
    and 'extinctions', which are the counts of these variables at time steps.
    Another column, 'pseudoextinctions' will be included when
    ``persists_post_speciation`` is False. This variable is the count of
    occurrences when a parent taxon became non-extant due to speciation and not
    because of an absence of zones.
