# SpeciesEvolver: evolve life in simulated landscapes

[![status](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/446f3d17d642682b234ffed2b53198f6/status.svg)](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/446f3d17d642682b234ffed2b53198f6)

Life evolves alongside landscapes by biotic and abiotic processes under complex
dynamics at Earth's surface. Researchers who wish to explore these dynamics can
use this component as a tool for them to build landscape-life evolution models.
Landlab components, including SpeciesEvolver are designed to work with a shared
model grid. Researchers can build novel models using plug-and-play surface
process components to evolve the grid's landscape alongside the life tracked by
SpeciesEvolver. The simulated life evolves following customizable processes.

## Documentation and installation

Landlab documentation is hosted on this [ReadTheDocs page](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master), including Landlab installation instructions. SpeciesEvolver is installed with Landlab.

SpeciesEvolver documentation is located [here](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/reference/components/species_evolution.html).

## SpeciesEvolver tutorial

A tutorial of this component exists in the form of a Jupyter Notebook. It is
located in ``/landlab/notebooks/tutorials`` titled, ``Introduction_to_SpeciesEvolver.ipynb``.

A static version of the same tutorial can be viewed [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/landlab/landlab/blob/master/notebooks/tutorials/species_evolution/Introduction_to_SpeciesEvolver.ipynb).

All Landlab tutorials can be launched from [this directory](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=welcome.ipynb) using binder.
