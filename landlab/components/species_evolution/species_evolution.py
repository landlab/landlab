class SpeciesEvolver(Component):
    """Simulate the development of lineages in a landscape.

    This component along with ``Species`` objects can be used in models to
    develop organismal lineages as they develop in response to landscape
    change. The history of lineages (phylogeny) are tracked through species.
    Evolution processes are conducted by Species objects. Species are intended
    to be subclassed for unique species behavior, attributes, and model
    approaches. The component stores species objects and calls the species
    evolutionary process methods.

    The general workflow to use this component in a model is

    1. Instantiate the component.
    2. Instantiate species.
    3. Introduce species using the SpeciesEvolver ``introduce_species`` method.
    4. Advance the model in time using the ``run_one_step`` method.

    Species can be introduced at model onset and later time steps. Species can
    be ``ZoneSpecies`` and other ``Species`` subclass types, and multiple types
    may be introduced to the same SpeciesEvolver instance.

    The species type, ``ZoneSpecies`` is distributed with SpeciesEvolver.
    Species of this type evolve through the processes of dispersal, speciation,
    and extinction. The spatial aspect of these processes is determined using
    ``Zone`` objects. A ``ZoneController`` is used to create and manage
    zones as well as efficiently create multiple ZoneSpecies. See the
    documentation of ``ZoneController`` for more information. SpeciesEvolver
    knows nothing about zones and their controller, meaning the concept of
    zones are not required for other species types.

    Time and other variables can be accessed with the class attribute,
    ``record``. Model time is tracked to construct phylogeny. The unit of time
    is not considered within the component and can be thought of as in years or
    whatever unit is needed. Time is advanced using the `dt` parameter of the
    ``run_one_step`` method.

    The ``run_one_step`` method evolves the species extant at the current time.
    The persistence or extinction of a species is determined by the species.
    Creation of child species is also determined by species. Species metadata
    of a component instance can be accessed with the attribute, ``species``.

    Species are assigned identifiers in the order they are introduced. The
    identifier is a two element tuple automatically generated by
    SpeciesEvolver. The first element is the clade id. Clades are lettered from
    A to Z then AA to AZ and so forth as more clades are created. The second
    identifier element designates the clade members numbered in the order of
    appearance. For example, the first species introduced is A.0 and if that
    species speciates, the first child species is A.1.

    The development of this component was inspired by SEAMLESS (Spatially
    Explicit Area Model of Landscape Evolution by SimulationS). See Albert et
    al., 2017, Systematic Biology 66.

    Examples
    --------
    The evolution of a lowland species lineage in response to mountain range
    formation is simulated using ZoneSpecies managed by ZoneController.
    Mountain range formation is forced without processes for simplicity in this
    example.

    >>> from landlab import RasterModelGrid
    >>> from landlab.components import SpeciesEvolver
    >>> from landlab.components.species_evolution import ZoneController

    Create a model grid with mountain scale resolution. The elevation is the
    same throughout the grid at model outset.

    >>> mg = RasterModelGrid((3, 7), 1000)
    >>> z = mg.add_ones('topographic__elevation', at='node')
    >>> z.reshape(mg.shape)
    array([[ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.],
           [ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.],
           [ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.]])

    Instantiate the component with the grid.

    >>> se = SpeciesEvolver(mg)

    ZoneController requires a function that returns a mask of the total
    extent of species habitat. The mask is a boolean array where `True` values
    represent nodes that satisfy habitat conditions. Zone objects of species
    are not created here. The mask only delineates the extent where species can
    exist. This function returns `True` where elevation is below 100, where the
    simulated lowland species of this model can inhabit.

    >>> def zone_func(grid):
    ...     return grid.at_node['topographic__elevation'] < 100

    Instantiate ZoneController with the grid and zone function. The
    initial zones are created at instantiation. In this example, one zone is
    created because all nodes of the zone mask are adjacent to each other.

    >>> zc = ZoneController(mg, zone_func)
    >>> len(zc.zones) == 1
    True

    The mask of the sole zone is True where the conditions of the zone function
    are met. All nodes of the grid are included because the elevation of each
    node is below 100 units.

    >>> zc.zones[0].mask
    array([ True,  True,  True,  True,  True,  True,  True,  True,  True,
            True,  True,  True,  True,  True,  True,  True,  True,  True,
            True,  True,  True], dtype=bool)

    Introduce a species to the zone. The component attribute, ``species``
    indicates only the one species exists.

    >>> species = zc.populate_zones_uniformly(1)
    >>> se.introduce_species(species)
    >>> se.species
      clade  number  time_appeared  latest_time
    0     A       0              0            0

    Force a change in the zone mask to demonstrate component functionality.
    Here we begin a new time step where topography is uplifted by 200 length
    units forming a ridge that trends north-south in the center of the grid.

    >>> z[[3, 10, 17]] = 200

    The elevation after uplift is represented here.

    - - - ^ - - -       elevation:  - 1
    - - - ^ - - -                   ^ 200
    - - - ^ - - -

    The updated zone mask is below.

    . . . x . . .       key:    . node in zone mask
    . . . x . . .               x node outside of zone mask
    . . . x . . .

    Run a step of both the ZoneController and SpeciesEvolver. Two zones now
    exits.

    >>> dt = 1000
    >>> zc.run_one_step(dt)
    >>> se.run_one_step(dt)
    >>> zones = zc.zones
    >>> len(zones) == 2
    True

    A new zone was created because the zone mask was not continuous.

    . . . ^ * * *       key:    . a zone
    . . . ^ * * *               * another zone
    . . . ^ * * *               ^ mountain range

    The split of the initial zone triggered speciation. Species A.0 became
    extinct as it speciated to child species, A.1 and A.2.

    >>> se.species
      clade  number  time_appeared  latest_time
    0     A       0              0            0
    1     A       1           1000         1000
    2     A       2           1000         1000
