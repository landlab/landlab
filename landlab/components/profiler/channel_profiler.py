class ChannelProfiler(_BaseProfiler):
    """Extract and plot the channel profiles in drainage networks.

    The ChannelProfiler extracts channel networks from a landlab grid.

    In order to extract channel networks, the flow connectivity across the grid
    must already be identified. This is typically done with the FlowAccumulator
    component. However, this component does not require that the
    FlowAccumulator was used. Instead it expects that the following at-node
    grid fields will be present:
    ::

        'flow__receiver_node'
        'flow__link_to_receiver_node'

    The ChannelProfiler can work on grids that have used route-to-one or
    route-to-multiple flow directing.

    To understand how this component works it is useful to define the following
    terms: *watershed*, *outlet*, *headwater node*, *segment*.

    A *watershed* is all model grid nodes that drain to a single node, called
    the *outlet*. Channels nodes are identified as nodes that have a
    ``channel_definition_field`` value greater than or equal to the
    ``minimum_channel_threshold``. This ``channel_definition_field`` is often
    the drainage area (this component's default). We use a flexible field
    rather than only drainage area to support alternative bases for channel
    extraction.

    The default behaviour of this component is to use an exclusive definition
    of a *watershed*. That is, the two largest watersheds are defined as the
    watersheds upstream of the two nodes on the model grid boundary with the
    largest values of the ``channel_definition_field`` rather than potentially
    nested watersheds. Nested watersheds are supported through the use of the
    ``outlet_nodes`` keyword argument.

    Consider the following grid with 10 columns and 7 rows. In this grid is one
    watershed with an outlet node indicated by ``o``. Here ``X`` indicates
    nodes that are not part of the channel network (based on the
    ``channel_definition_field``) and ``.`` indicates nodes that are part of
    the network.

    In this and the following examples, we will use only D4 connectivity. The
    ChannelProfiler, however, knows nothing of connectivity other than what is
    implied by the two required grid fields.
    ::

        X X X X X X X X X X
        X . X X X X X X X X
        X . . X X X . . . X
        X X . . X X . X X X
        X X X . . . . X X X
        X X X . X X X X X X
        X X X o X X X X X X

    This component can extract the channel network from one or more watersheds.
    This option is specified with the keyword argument
    ``number_of_watersheds``.

    The *headwater nodes*, shown as ``@`` are nodes that have no upstream
    nodes with sufficient area to be classified as a channel.
    ::

        X X X X X X X X X X
        X @ X X X X X X X X
        X . . X X X . . @ X
        X X . . X X . X X X
        X X X . . . . X X X
        X X X . X X X X X X
        X X X o X X X X X X

    For each watershed, the ChannelProfiler either extracts the largest channel
    (again, based on the ``channel_definition_field``) or all channel segments
    with sufficent values in the ``channel_definition_field``.

    Default behavior of this component is to extract only the largest channel
    in the single largest watershed. This would extract the following channel
    segment (indicated by the `*` s).
    ::

        X X X X X X X X X X
        X . X X X X X X X X
        X . . X X X * * * X
        X X . . X X * X X X
        X X X * * * * X X X
        X X X * X X X X X X
        X X X * X X X X X X

    This component verifies that all watershed outlets have a value in the
    ``channel_definition_field`` of at least ``minimum_outlet_threshold``
    (default is 0 units). If no watersheds exist that meet this criteria, an
    error is raised.

    If a user knows exactly which node or nodes they want to use as the outlet
    nodes, then this can be specified using the ``outlet_nodes`` keyword
    argument. Otherwise the ``number_of_watersheds`` (default 1) nodes with the
    largest value in the ``channel_definition_field`` will be selected as the
    outlet nodes from the model grid boundary nodes. Setting
    ``number_of_watersheds`` to ``None`` results in selecting all nodes at the
    model grid boundary that meet the criteria for an outlet based on the
    ``channel_definition_field`` and the ``minimum_outlet_threshold``.

    The node IDs and distances upstream of the channel network are stored in
    ``data_structure``. It is a dictionary with keys indicating the outlet
    node.

    For each watershed outlet, the value in the ``data_structure`` is itself
    a dictionary with keys that are a segment ID tuple of the
    ``(dowstream, upstream)`` nodes IDs of each channel segment.

    For our simple example, these are the node IDs:
    ::

            X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X
            X 51  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X
            X 41 42  X  X  X 46 47 48  X
            X  X 32 33  X  X 36  X  X  X
            X  X  X 23 24 25 26  X  X  X
            X  X  X 13  X  X  X  X  X  X
            X  X  X  3  X  X  X  X  X  X

    So for our main channel only example, the outlet has an ID of 3, the
    downstream end of the channel segment is 3, and the upstream end is 48.

    The value associated with the segment ID tuple ``(3, 48)`` is itself a
    dictionary. It has three key-value pairs. First, ``"ids"`` contains a list
    of the segment node ids ordered from downstream to upstream. It includes
    the endpoints. Second, ``"distances"`` contains a list of distances
    upstream that mirrors the list in ``"ids"``. Finally, ``"color"`` is an
    RGBA tuple indicating the color for the segment.

    By default a unique color will be assigned to each watershed. To change the
    color, a user can change values stored in ``data_structure``.
    Additionally, a ``cmap`` keyword argument can provide some user control
    over the color at the instantiation of the component.

    In the main channel only example, the data structure will look as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        {3: {
            (3, 48) : {
                "ids": [3, 13, 23, 24, 25, 26, 36, 46, 47, 48],
                "distances": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
                "color": (1, 0, 1, 1),
                }
            }
        }

    Three channel segments are idendified if ``main_channel_only=False``.
    ::

        X X X X X X X X X X     X X X X X X X X X X     X X X X X X X X X X
        X . X X X X X X X X     X . X X X X X X X X     X * X X X X X X X X
        X . . X X X . . . X     X . . X X X * * * X     X * * X X X . . . X
        X X . . X X . X X X     X X . . X X * X X X     X X * * X X . X X X
        X X X * . . . X X X     X X X * * * * X X X     X X X * . . . X X X
        X X X * X X X X X X     X X X . X X X X X X     X X X . X X X X X X
        X X X * X X X X X X     X X X . X X X X X X     X X X . X X X X X X

    The data structure associated with this set of three segments is

        .. code-block:: python

            {3: {
                (3, 23) : {
                    "ids": [3, 13, 23],
                    "distances": [0, 1, 2]
                    "color": (1, 0, 1, 1),
                    },
                (23, 48) : {
                    "ids": [23, 24, 25, 26, 36, 46, 47, 48],
                    "distances": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
                    "color": (1, 0, 1, 1),
                    },
                (23, 51) : {
                    "ids": [23, 33, 32, 42, 41, 51],
                    "distances": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
                    "color": (1, 0, 1, 1),
                    },
                }
            }

    Note that the distances upstream are relative to the outlet, not the
    downstream end of the stream segment.

    Next consider a model grid with two watersheds.
    ::

        X X X X X X X X X X
        X . . X X X . X X X
        X . X X . X . X X X
        o . . . . X . X X X
        X X X X X X . X X X
        X X X . . . . X X X
        X X X X X X . . . X
        X X X X X X X X o X

    And the following node IDs.
    ::

        X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X
        X  61  62   X   X   X  66   X   X   X
        X  51   X   X  54   X  56   X   X   X
       40  41  42  43  44   X  46   X   X   X
        X   X   X   X   X   X  36   X   X   X
        X   X   X  23  24  25  26   X   X   X
        X   X   X   X   X   X  16  17  18   X
        X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   8   X


    The data structure for ``number_of_watersheds=2`` and
    ``main_channel_only=False`` will be as follows. Note that each watershed
    has been assigned a different color tuple value. Here the default viridis
    cmap is used.

    .. code-block:: python

        {8: {
            (8, 26) : {
                "ids": [8, 18, 17, 16, 26],
                "distances": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
                "color": [ 0.13,  0.57,  0.55,  1.  ],
                },
            (26, 23) : {
                "ids": [26, 25, 24, 23],
                "distances": [4, 5, 6, 7],
                "color": [ 0.13,  0.57,  0.55,  1.  ],
                },
            (26, 66) : {
                "ids": [26, 36, 46, 56, 66],
                "distances": [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
                "color": [ 0.13,  0.57,  0.55,  1.  ],
                },
            },
         40: {
            (40, 41) : {
                "ids": [40, 41],
                "distances": [0, 1]
                "color": [ 0.27,  0.  ,  0.33,  1.  ],
                },
            (41, 54) : {
                "ids": [41, 42, 43, 44, 54],
                "distances": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
                "color": [ 0.27,  0.  ,  0.33,  1.  ],
                },
            (41, 62) : {
                "ids": [41, 51, 61, 62],
                "distances": [1, 2, 3, 4]
                "color": [ 0.27,  0.  ,  0.33,  1.  ],
                },
            }
        }

    Examples
    --------

    Start by importing necessary modules

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from landlab import RasterModelGrid
    >>> from landlab.components import FlowAccumulator, ChannelProfiler

    Create the second example grid we showed above. Note that in order to do
    this we need to enter the elevations starting from the lower left so the
    elevation order may seem upside-down    .

    >>> z = np.array([ 0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  1,  0,
    ...                0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  4,  3,  2,  0,
    ...                0,  0,  0,  8,  7,  6,  5,  0,  0,  0,
    ...                0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  6,  0,  0,  0,
    ...                1,  3,  4,  5,  6,  0,  7,  0,  0,  0,
    ...                0,  4,  0,  0,  7,  0,  8,  0,  0,  0,
    ...                0,  5,  6,  0,  0,  0,  9,  0,  0,  0,
    ...                0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,], dtype=float)

    >>> mg = RasterModelGrid((8, 10))
    >>> z = mg.add_field("topographic__elevation", z, at="node")
    >>> mg.set_nodata_nodes_to_closed(z, 0)
    >>> fa = FlowAccumulator(mg, flow_director='D4')
    >>> fa.run_one_step()
    >>> fa.node_drainage_area.reshape(mg.shape)
    array([[  0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,  11.,   0.],
           [  0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   9.,  10.,  11.,   0.],
           [  0.,   0.,   0.,   1.,   2.,   3.,   8.,   0.,   0.,   0.],
           [  0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   4.,   0.,   0.,   0.],
           [  8.,   8.,   4.,   3.,   2.,   0.,   3.,   0.,   0.,   0.],
           [  0.,   3.,   0.,   0.,   1.,   0.,   2.,   0.,   0.,   0.],
           [  0.,   2.,   1.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   1.,   0.,   0.,   0.],
           [  0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.]])

    >>> profiler = ChannelProfiler(
    ...     mg,
    ...     number_of_watersheds=2,
    ...     minimum_channel_threshold=0,
    ...     main_channel_only=False)
    >>> profiler.run_one_step()

    The keys of the property ``data_structure`` are the IDs  of the two
    outlet nodes.

    >>> profiler.data_structure.keys()
    odict_keys([40, 8])

    Within the data structure, the value at key 40, is a dictionary of the
    three segments, each specified by a ``(dowstream, upstream)`` tuple:

    >>> profiler.data_structure[40].keys()
    odict_keys([(40, 41), (41, 54), (41, 62)])

    The value of the segment between nodes 40 and 41 has the following
    components:

    >>> profiler.data_structure[40][(40, 41)]["ids"]
    array([40, 41])
    >>> profiler.data_structure[40][(40, 41)]["distances"]
    array([ 0.,  1.])
    >>> np.round(profiler.data_structure[40][(40, 41)]["color"], decimals=2)
    array([ 0.27,  0.  ,  0.33,  1.  ])

    A parallel structure exists for the segment between nodes 41 and 54:

    >>> profiler.data_structure[40][(41, 54)]["ids"]
    array([41, 42, 43, 44, 54])
    >>> profiler.data_structure[40][(41, 54)]["distances"]
    array([ 1.,  2.,  3.,  4.,  5.])
    >>> np.round(profiler.data_structure[40][(41, 54)]["color"], decimals=2)
    array([ 0.27,  0.  ,  0.33,  1.  ])

    And the segment between nodes 41  and 62.

    >>> profiler.data_structure[40][(41, 62)]["ids"]
    array([41, 51, 61, 62])
    >>> profiler.data_structure[40][(41, 62)]["distances"]
    array([ 1.,  2.,  3.,  4.])
    >>> np.round(profiler.data_structure[40][(41, 62)]["color"], decimals=2)
    array([ 0.27,  0.  ,  0.33,  1.  ])

    The rest of the ``profile_structure`` encodes information about the second
    watershed, which drains to node 8.

    >>> profiler.data_structure[8].keys()
    odict_keys([(8, 26), (26, 23), (26, 66)])

    >>> profiler.data_structure[8][(8, 26)]["ids"]
    array([ 8, 18, 17, 16, 26])
    >>> profiler.data_structure[8][(8, 26)]["distances"]
    array([ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.,  4.])
    >>> np.round(profiler.data_structure[8][(8, 26)]["color"], decimals=2)
    array([ 0.13,  0.57,  0.55,  1.  ])

    >>> profiler.data_structure[8][(26, 23)]["ids"]
    array([26, 25, 24, 23])
    >>> profiler.data_structure[8][(26, 23)]["distances"]
    array([ 4.,  5.,  6.,  7.])
    >>> np.round(profiler.data_structure[8][(26, 23)]["color"], decimals=2)
    array([ 0.13,  0.57,  0.55,  1.  ])

    >>> profiler.data_structure[8][(26, 66)]["ids"]
    array([26, 36, 46, 56, 66])
    >>> profiler.data_structure[8][(26, 66)]["distances"]
    array([ 4.,  5.,  6.,  7.,  8.])
    >>> np.round(profiler.data_structure[8][(26, 66)]["color"], decimals=2)
    array([ 0.13,  0.57,  0.55,  1.  ])

    The ChannelProfiler is designed to be flexible, and by careful combination
    of its instantiation variables can be used to extract many useful forms of
    profile. In these examples, we will use the default
    ``channel_definition_field``, the drainage area.

    To illustrate, lets start by creating a landscape model.

    >>> from landlab.components import FastscapeEroder
    >>> mg = RasterModelGrid((100, 120), xy_spacing=2)
    >>> np.random.seed(42)
    >>> z = mg.add_zeros('topographic__elevation', at='node')
    >>> z[mg.core_nodes] += np.random.randn(mg.core_nodes.size)
    >>> fa = FlowAccumulator(mg)
    >>> sp = FastscapeEroder(mg, K_sp=0.0001)
    >>> dt = 1000
    >>> for i in range(200):
    ...     fa.run_one_step()
    ...     sp.run_one_step(dt=dt)
    ...     z[mg.core_nodes] += 0.001 * dt

    Some options:

    Default: Extract a the single biggest channel draining to the model grid
    boundary traced back all the way to the watershed divide.

    >>> profiler = ChannelProfiler(mg)

    Extract the largest channel draining to each of the four largest outlet
    nodes on the model grid boundary traced back all the way to the watershed
    divide.

    >>> profiler = ChannelProfiler(mg, number_of_watersheds=4)

    Extract the single largest channel draining to node 2933. Note that the
    keyword argument ``outlet_nodes`` must be an iterable.

    >>> profiler = ChannelProfiler(mg, outlet_nodes=[2933])

    Extract the largest channel draining to each of the four largest outlet
    nodes on the model grid boundary traced back to nodes with
    ``channel_definition_field`` values of 500.

    >>> profiler = ChannelProfiler(
