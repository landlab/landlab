class TrickleDownProfiler(_BaseProfiler):
    """Extract and a profile from one or more node IDs to their downstream termini.

    The TrickleDownProfiler extracts channel networks from a landlab grid.
    Unlike the ChannelProfiler which starts at one or more watershed outlets
    and works upstream until it reaches the end of the channel (based on
    a specified threshold, such as drainage area) the TrickleDownProfiler
    starts at a *starting node* and works its way downhill until it reaches
    an outlet or sink.

    In order to follow the channel network, the flow connectivity across the
    grid must already be identified. This is typically done with the
    FlowAccumulator component. However, this component does not require that the
    FlowAccumulator was used. Instead it expects that the following at-node
    grid fields will be present:
    ::

        'flow__receiver_node'
        'flow__link_to_receiver_node'

    The TrickleDownProfiler can work on grids that have used route-to-one or
    route-to-multiple flow directing.

    To understand how this component works it is useful to define the following
    terms: *outlet*, *starting node*, and *segment*.

    Consider the following grid with 10 columns and 7 rows. ``@`` represents
    the *starting node*, ``.`` represents the nodes downstream, and the
    watershed outlet node is indicated by ``o``.

    In this and the following examples, we will use only D4 connectivity. The
    ChannelProfiler, however, knows nothing of connectivity other than what is
    implied by the two required grid fields.
    ::

        X X X X X X X X X X
        X X X X X X X X X X
        X X X X X X . . @ X
        X X X X X X . X X X
        X X X . . . . X X X
        X X X . X X X X X X
        X X X o X X X X X X

    For each starting node, the TrickleDownProfiler follows the network
    downstream until it reaches the outlet or sink. One or more starting nodes
    can be used, depending on a user's needs.

    The node IDs and distances upstream of the channel network are stored in
    ``data_structure``. It is a dictionary with keys indicating the starting
    node.

    For each starting node, the value in the ``data_structure`` is itself
    a dictionary with keys that are a segment ID tuple of the
    ``(dowstream, upstream)`` nodes IDs of each channel segment.

    For our simple example, these are the node IDs:
    ::

            X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X
            X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X
            X  X  X  X  X  X 46 47 48  X
            X  X  X  X  X  X 36  X  X  X
            X  X  X 23 24 25 26  X  X  X
            X  X  X 13  X  X  X  X  X  X
            X  X  X  3  X  X  X  X  X  X

    The starting node is 48 and the outlet node is 3.

    The value associated with the segment ID tuple ``(3, 48)`` is itself a
    dictionary. It has three key-value pairs. First, ``"ids"`` contains a list
    of the segment node ids ordered from downstream to upstream. It includes
    the endpoints. Second, ``"distances"`` contains a list of distances
    upstream that mirrors the list in ``"ids"``. Finally, ``"color"`` is an
    RGBA tuple indicating the color for the segment.

    By default a unique color will be assigned to each starting node. To change
    the color, a user can change values stored in ``data_structure``.
    Additionally, a ``cmap`` keyword argument can provide some user control
    over the color at the instantiation of the component.

    For example with a starting node of 48, the data structure will look as
    follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        {48: {
            (3, 48) : {
                "ids": [3, 13, 23, 24, 25, 26, 36, 46, 47, 48],
                "distances": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
                "color": (1, 0, 1, 1),
                }
            }
        }

    Note that the distances upstream are relative to the outlet.

    Next consider an example with two starting nodes, each noted with an ``@``.
    ::

        X X X X X X X X X X
        X X X X X X @ X X X
        X X X X @ X . X X X
        o . . . . X . X X X
        X X X X X X . X X X
        X X X X X X . X X X
        X X X X X X . . . X
        X X X X X X X X o X

    And the following node IDs.
    ::

        X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X
        X   X   X   X   X   X  66   X   X   X
        X   X   X   X  54   X  56   X   X   X
       40  41  42  43  44   X  46   X   X   X
        X   X   X   X   X   X  36   X   X   X
        X   X   X   X   X   X  26   X   X   X
        X   X   X   X   X   X  16  17  18   X
        X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   8   X

    With our starting nodes of 54 and 66 our data structure will look like.

    .. code-block:: python

        {54: {
            (40, 54) : {
                "ids": [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 54],
                "distances": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6],
                "color": [ 0.27,  0.  ,  0.33,  1.  ],
                },
            }
        66: {
            (8, 66) : {
                "ids": [8, 18, 17, 16, 26, 36, 46, 56, 66],
                "distances": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
                "color": [ 0.13,  0.57,  0.55,  1.  ],
                },
        }

    Examples
    --------

    Start by importing necessary modules

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from landlab import RasterModelGrid
    >>> from landlab.components import FlowAccumulator, TrickleDownProfiler

    Create the second example grid we showed above. Note that in order to do
    this we need to enter the elevations starting from the lower left so the
    elevation order may seem upside-down. In addition, in this example,
    elevation is only provided along the profiles. The third line of code below
    sets all nodes with a value of zero to closed, such that these nodes are
    igored.
    >>> z = np.array([ 0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  1,  0,
    ...                0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  4,  3,  2,  0,
    ...                0,  0,  0,  8,  7,  6,  5,  0,  0,  0,
    ...                0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  6,  0,  0,  0,
    ...                1,  3,  4,  5,  6,  0,  7,  0,  0,  0,
    ...                0,  4,  0,  0,  7,  0,  8,  0,  0,  0,
    ...                0,  5,  6,  0,  0,  0,  9,  0,  0,  0,
    ...                0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,], dtype=float)

    >>> mg = RasterModelGrid((8, 10))
    >>> z = mg.add_field("topographic__elevation", z, at="node")
    >>> mg.set_nodata_nodes_to_closed(z, 0)
    >>> fa = FlowAccumulator(mg, flow_director='D4')
    >>> fa.run_one_step()
    >>> fa.node_drainage_area.reshape(mg.shape)
    array([[  0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,  11.,   0.],
           [  0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   9.,  10.,  11.,   0.],
           [  0.,   0.,   0.,   1.,   2.,   3.,   8.,   0.,   0.,   0.],
           [  0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   4.,   0.,   0.,   0.],
           [  8.,   8.,   4.,   3.,   2.,   0.,   3.,   0.,   0.,   0.],
           [  0.,   3.,   0.,   0.,   1.,   0.,   2.,   0.,   0.,   0.],
           [  0.,   2.,   1.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   1.,   0.,   0.,   0.],
           [  0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.]])

    >>> profiler = TrickleDownProfiler(
    ...     mg,
    ...     starting_nodes=[54, 66])
    >>> profiler.run_one_step()

    The keys of the property ``data_structure`` are the IDs of the two outlet
    nodes.

    >>> profiler.data_structure.keys()
    odict_keys([54, 66])

    Within the data structure, the value at key 54, is a dictionary of the
    one segment, each specified by a ``(dowstream, upstream)`` tuple:

    >>> profiler.data_structure[54].keys()
    dict_keys([(40, 54)])

    The value of the segment between nodes 40 and 54 has the following
    components:

    >>> profiler.data_structure[54][(40, 54)]["ids"]
    array([40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 54])
    >>> profiler.data_structure[54][(40, 54)]["distances"]
    array([ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.,  4.,  5.])
    >>> np.round(profiler.data_structure[54][(40, 54)]["color"], decimals=2)
    array([ 0.27,  0.  ,  0.33,  1.  ])

    The rest of the ``profile_structure`` encodes information about the second
    profile which starts at node 66.

    >>> profiler.data_structure[66].keys()
    dict_keys([(8, 66)])

    >>> profiler.data_structure[66][(8, 66)]["ids"]
    array([ 8, 18, 17, 16, 26, 36, 46, 56, 66])
    >>> profiler.data_structure[66][(8, 66)]["distances"]
    array([ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.,  4.,  5.,  6.,  7.,  8.])
    >>> np.round(profiler.data_structure[66][(8, 66)]["color"], decimals=2)
    array([ 0.13,  0.57,  0.55,  1.  ])
