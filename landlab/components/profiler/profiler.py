class Profiler(_BaseProfiler):
    """Extract and plot profiles set up using points within a grid.

    The profile is constructed from the first to final point in ``endpoints``.
    Endpoints are located at grid nodes. Two successive endpoints bound a
    profile segment. A profile with one segment is a straight line. The
    segments of a profile with multiple segments meet at endpoints. The grid
    nodes along the profile are sampled, including the segment endpoints. The
    extracted quantity of the node is retained. No interpolation is conducted
    even for profile traces that reside between nodes.

    The structure of the profile in a model grid is diagrammed below. The grid
    contains nine columns and nine rows. The profile is constructed from three
    endpoints that bound two segments. Here, ``o`` indicates a segment
    endpoint, ``.`` and ``*`` are sample nodes of the first and second segment,
    respectively. ``X`` are nodes not included in the profile. The first
    segment begins in the lower-left and continues horizontally and almost
    reaches the right boundary. The second segment is joined to the first in
    the lower-right of the grid and it continues diagonally to the upper-left.
    Segments have seven sample points each (nodes at endpoints are also
    sampled). The segments share the second endpoint. Segment and sample
    ordering is dictated by the ordering of endpoints. If the horizontal
    segment is the first segment, the endpoints used to construct this profile
    must be ordered: lower-left, lower-right, and then upper-left.::

        X X X X X X X X X
        X o X X X X X X X
        X X * X X X X X X
        X X X * X X X X X
        X X X X * X X X X
        X X X X X * X X X
        X X X X X X * X X
        X o . . . . . o X
        X X X X X X X X X

    The node IDs and distances along the profile are stored in a data structure
    called ``data_structure``. It is a dictionary with keys indicating the
    segment IDs that are enumerated along the profile.

    By default, a unique color will be assigned to each segment. To change the
    color, a user can change values stored in ``data_structure``. Additionally,
    a ``cmap`` keyword argument can provide some user control over the color at
    the instantiation of the component.

    The data structure of the example above will look as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        {0: {
            'ids': [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16],
            'distances': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
            'color': (0.27,  0,  0.33,  1)
            },
         1: {
            'ids': [16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64],
            'distances': [6, 7.41, 8.83, 10.24, 11.66, 13.07, 14.49]
            'color': (0.13,  0.57,  0.55,  1)
            }
        }


    Examples
    --------
    Create a model grid with the same dimensions as the diagram above.

    >>> from landlab import RasterModelGrid
    >>> from landlab.components import Profiler
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> mg = RasterModelGrid((10, 10), 10)
    >>> mg.at_node['topographic__elevation'] = mg.node_x * mg.node_y

    Create a profile with three endpoints. This profile is laid out the same as
    the diagram above.

    >>> endpoints = [10, 16, 64]
    >>> profiler = Profiler(mg, endpoints)
    >>> profiler.run_one_step()

    The keys of the data structure are the segment ids.

    >>> profiler.data_structure.keys()
    odict_keys([0, 1])

    The data structure contains data of segment samples. Below is the first
    segment.

    >>> profiler.data_structure[0]['ids']
    array([10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16])
    >>> profiler.data_structure[0]['distances']
    array([  0.,  10.,  20.,  30.,  40.,  50.,  60.])
    >>> np.round(profiler.data_structure[0]['color'], decimals=2)
    array([ 0.27,  0.  ,  0.33,  1.  ])

    Note that the first node of the second segment is the same as the final
    node of the first segment.

    >>> profiler.data_structure[1]['ids']
    array([16, 26, 35, 45, 54, 64])

    Alternative to nodes, profiles can be instantiated with coordinates.

    >>> profiler = Profiler(mg, [(10, 10), (70, 10), (10, 70)])

    Endpoints can also be set with a combination of coordinates and nodes.

    >>> profiler = Profiler(mg, [(10, 10), 16, (10, 70)])
