class StreamPowerEroder(Component):
    """Erode where channels are.

    Implemented as:

    .. math::
        E = K A^m S^n - sp_{crit},

    and if :math:`E < 0`, :math:`E = 0`.

    If ``use_W`` is declared and ``True``, the module instead implements:

    .. math::
        E = K A^m S^n / W - sp_{crit}

    DEJH Sept 2013, major modifications Sept 14 and May 16. This component
    now wraps Fastscape-style functionality under the hood.

    Note that although the Braun-Willett (2013) scheme that underlies this
    component is nominally implicit, and will reach a numerically-correct
    solution under topographic steady state regardless of timestep length, the
    accuracy of transient solutions is *not* timestep independent (see
    Braun & Willett 2013, Appendix B for further details).
    Although the scheme remains significantly more robust and permits longer
    timesteps than a traditional explicit solver under such conditions, it
    is still possible to create numerical instability through use of too long
    a timestep while using this component. The user is cautioned to check their
    implementation is behaving stably before fully trusting it.

    NB: If you want spatially or temporally variable runoff, pass the
    runoff values at each pixel to the flow router using the input argument
    *use_Q*.

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid : ModelGrid
            A grid.
        K_sp : float, array, or field name
            K in the stream power equation (units vary with other parameters).
        threshold_sp : positive float, optional
            The threshold stream power, below which no erosion occurs. This
            threshold is assumed to be in "stream power" units, i.e., if
            sp_type is 'Shear_stress', the value should be tau**a.
        sp_type : {'set_mn', 'Total', 'Unit', 'Shear_stress'}
            Controls how the law is implemented. If 'set_mn', use the supplied
            values of m_sp and n_sp. Else, component will derive values of m and n
            from supplied values of a_sp, b_sp, and c_sp, following Whipple and
            Tucker:

            *  If ``'Total'``, ``m = a * c``, ``n = a``.
            *  If ``'Unit'``, ``m = a * c *(1 - b)``, ``n = a``.
            *  If ``'Shear_stress'``, ``m = 2 * a * c * (1 - b) / 3``,
               ``n = 2 * a / 3``.

        m_sp : float, optional
            m in the stream power equation (power on drainage area). Overridden if
            a_sp, b_sp, and c_sp are supplied.
        n_sp : float, optional, ~ 0.5<n_sp<4.
            n in the stream power equation (power on slope). Overridden if
            a_sp, b_sp, and c_sp are supplied.
        a_sp : float, optional
            The power on the SP/shear term to get the erosion rate; the "erosional
            process" term. Only used if sp_type is not 'set_mn'.
        b_sp : float, optional
            The power on discharge to get width; the "hydraulic geometry" term.
            Only used if sp_type in ('Unit', 'Shear_stress').
        c_sp : float, optional
            The power on area to get discharge; the "basin hydology" term. Only
            used if sp_type is not 'set_mn'.
        use_W : None, array, or field name, optional
            If not None, component will look for node-centered data describing
            channel width in grid.at_node[use_W] or if an array, will take the
            array as the channel widths. It will use the widths to implement
            incision ~ stream power per unit width. If sp_type is 'set_mn',
            follows the equation given above. If sp_type in ('Unit',
            'Shear_stress'), the width value will be implemented directly. W has no
            effect if sp_type is 'Total'.
        use_Q : None, array, or field name, optional
            If not None, the equation becomes E=K*Q**m*S**n. Effectively sets c=1
            in Wh&T's 1999 derivation, if you are setting m and n through a, b,
            and c.

            This run method is now DEPRECATED. Use the fully standardized
            method :func:`run_one_step` instead.

        A simple, explicit implementation of a stream power algorithm.

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid : RasterModelGrid
            A grid.
        dt : float
            Component time step.

        elevs : str or ndarray, optional
            Elevations on the grid, either a field string or nnodes-long array.

        drainage_areas: str or ndarray, optional
            Tells the component where to look for the drainage area values.
            Change to another string to override which grid field the
            component looks at, or pass a nnodes-long array of drainage
            areas values directly instead.

        flow_receiver, order_upstream : str or ndarray, optional
            The downstream node to which each node flows and the ordering of
            the nodes in the network starting at the outlet, respectively,
            are both necessary as inputs to allow stability testing.

            If you already have slopes defined at nodes on the grid, pass them
            to the component with *slopes_at_nodes*. The same syntax is
            expected: string gives a name in the grid fields, an array gives
            values direct.

            Alternatively, set *link_slopes* (and *link_mapping*) if this
            data
            is only available at links. 'topographic__derivative_of_elevation'
            is the default field name for link slopes. Override this name by
            setting the variable as the appropriate string, or override use of
            grid fields altogether by passing an array. *link_mapping*
            controls how the component maps these link values onto the arrays.
            We assume there is always a 1:1 mapping (pass the values already
            projected onto the nodes using slopes_at_nodes if not). Other
            components, e.g., flow_routing.route_flow_dn, may provide the
            necessary outputs to make the mapping easier: e.g., just pass
            'flow__link_to_receiver_node' from that module (the default name).
            If the component cannot find an existing mapping through this
            parameter, it will derive one on the fly, at considerable cost of
            speed (see on-screen reports).

        slopes_from_elevs : str, optional
            Allows the module to create gradients internally
            from elevations rather than have them provided. Set to True to
            force the component to look for the data in the location specified
            by elevs. Using this option is
            considerably slower than any of the alternatives, as it also has to
            calculate the link_mapping from stratch each time.

            In both these cases, at present the mapping is to use the maximum
            slope of *any* link attached to the node as the representative
            node slope. This is primarily for speed, but may be a good idea
            to modify later.

        W_if_used, Q_if_used : str or ndarray, optional
            Must be provided if you set *use_W* and *use_Q* respectively in
            the component initialization. They can be either field names or
            nnodes arrays as in the other cases.

            If you are routing across flooded depressions in your flow routing
            scheme, be sure to set *flooded_nodes* with a boolean array or
            array of IDs to ensure erosion cannot occur in the lake. Erosion
            is always zero if the gradient is adverse, but can still procede as
            usual on the entry into the depression unless *flooded_nodes* is
            set.

            NB: If you want spatially or temporally variable runoff, pass the
            runoff values at each pixel to the flow router, then pass
            discharges at each node using *Q_if_used* to this component.

        Returns
        -------
        tuple
            Tuple of (*grid*, *modified_elevs*, *stream_power_erosion*);
            modifies grid elevation fields to reflect updates. Note the value
            stream_power_erosion is not an excess stream power; any specified
            erosion threshold is not incorporated into it.
