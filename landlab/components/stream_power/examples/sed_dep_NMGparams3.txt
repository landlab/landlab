#linear decline
#note this actually *won’t ever* be stable is m/n is the same for both DL & TL
#(increases in slope can always be balanced by rising Qs)
#So we adopt NMG’s values again:

initial_slope:
0.

#for U~0.0001

#4000000.
uplift_rate:
0.0005
#acceleration is 0.0001->0.0005
#time is years, ALL linear dimensions are meters!

#these are the parameters for the stream power module:
