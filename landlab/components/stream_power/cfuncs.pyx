    """Evaluates the solution to the water-depth equation.

    Called by scipy.brentq() to find solution for $x$ using Brent's method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : float
        normalized elevation, see below.
    alpha : float
        alpha parameter, see below.
    beta : float
        beta parameter, see below.
    n : float
        n exponent
    check : boolean, default is True
        flag to determine if a ValueError should be thrown if a check
        identifies that the threshold value is high enough such that no erosion
        will occur.


    This equation represents the implicit solution for normalized topographic
    elevation $x$ at the  next time step. This solution is inspired by the
    Appendix of Braun and Willet (2012) but was generalized to include an a
    threshold value such that if the threshold is not exceeded, no erosion will
    occur.

    Consider stream power erosion under the equation:

        E = K * (A)**m * S**n - threshold_sp,

    on a grid with link delta_x and for a timestep of delta_t.

    When iterating from downstream to upstream in the drainage stack, at a
    given node at time = t+delta_t, the value of the node at time = t, and the
    value of the downstream node at time t+delta_t is known.

    Define
    x = (z_node(t+delta_t) - z_downstream(t+delta_t))/(z_node(t) - z_downstream(t+delta_t)).

    A discretized version of the stream power equation above yeilds the equation

    f = x - 1 + alpha*(x**n) - beta

    where

    alpha = delta_t*K * (A)**m/(delta_x**n) * (z_node(t) - z_downstream(t+delta_t))**(n-1)

    and

    beta = threshold_sp*delta_t/(z_node(t) - z_downstream(t+delta_t))

    Finding the root of f provides the implicit solution for the stream power
    equation.

    If f(x=1) = 0, then no erosion occurs as potential erosion is cancelled by
    the erosion threshold and the topography at the given node does not change.

    If f(x=0) = 0, then the topography at the given node becomes that of the
    the downstream mode.

    If the threshold term, beta, is zero, this equation collapses to the form
    given by Braun and Willet (2012).

    When the threshold term is greater than zero, it is possible that no
    erosion will occur. In this case, an evaluation of f(x=1) will yeild a
    negative number.

    If for the values of alpha and beta provided, f(x=1)<0, then this function
    has no root and use in a solver such as Brent's method in which a solution
    interval is required will fail.

    It is recommended that before using this method in a solver, that the
    function be evaluated with x=1 to determine if it any erosion occured.
