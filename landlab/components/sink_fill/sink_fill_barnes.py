class SinkFillerBarnes(LakeMapperBarnes):
    """Uses the Barnes et al (2014) algorithms to replace pits in a topography
    with flats, or optionally with very shallow gradient surfaces to allow
    continued draining.

    This component is NOT intended for use iteratively as a model runs;
    rather, it is to fill in an initial topography. If you want to repeatedly
    fill pits as a landscape develops, you are after the LakeMapperBarnes
    component. If you want flow paths on your filled landscape, manually run a
    FlowDirector and FlowAccumulator for yourself.

    The locations and depths etc. of the fills will be tracked, and properties
    are provided to access this information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid : ModelGrid
        A grid.
    surface : field name at node or array of length node
        The surface to fill.
    method : {'Steepest', 'D8'}
        Whether or not to recognise diagonals as valid flow paths, if a raster.
        Otherwise, no effect.
    fill_flat : bool
        If True, pits will be filled to perfectly horizontal. If False, the new
        surface will be slightly inclined (at machine precision) to give
        steepest descent flow paths to the outlet, once they are calculated.
    ignore_overfill : bool
        If True, suppresses the Error that would normally be raised during
        creation of a gentle incline on a fill surface (i.e., if not
        fill_flat). Typically this would happen on a synthetic DEM where more
        than one outlet is possible at the same elevation. If True, the
        was_there_overfill property can still be used to see if this has
        occurred.

        True

        Unlike the LakeMapperBarnes equivalents, fill_depths and fill_volumes
        are always available through this component:

        >>> fill_depths = np.array([ 0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,
        ...                          0. ,  1. ,  0. ,  0.5,  0. ,  0. ,
        ...                          0. ,  0. ,  0.4,  0.7,  0. ,  0. ,
        ...                          0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0.1,  0. ,
        ...                          0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ])
        >>> np.allclose(sfb.fill_depths, fill_depths)
        True
        >>> np.allclose(sfb.fill_volumes, np.array([1.7, 1.]))
        True

        Note that with a flat fill, we can't drain the surface. The surface
        is completely flat, so each and every core node within the fill
        becomes a sink.

        >>> fr.run_one_step()
        >>> where_is_filled = np.where(sfb.fill_map > -1, 1, 0)
        >>> np.all(
        ...     mg.at_node['flow__sink_flag'][mg.core_nodes] ==
        ...     where_is_filled[mg.core_nodes])
        True

        (Note that the fill_map does not think that the perimeter nodes are
        sinks, since they haven't changed elevation. In contrast, the
        FlowAccumulator *does* think they are, because these nodes are where
        flow terminates.)
