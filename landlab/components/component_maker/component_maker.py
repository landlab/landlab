"""ComponentMaker is an example of how to make a component.

Congratulations on wanting to make a Landlab component! This file is part of a
set of files meant to make it easier for you to do this.

See also the :ref:`Develop your own component or utility <landlab_component_dev_page>`
page and the
`Creating a Component Tutorial <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/tutorials/making_components/making_components.ipynb>`_.

The Creating a Component Tutorial has information about many many parts of your
component. This file is not meant to replace this, but to provide a concrete
working example that includes all of the parts that we expect.

This text is called a docstring and it provides documentation about your
component. You'll use it describe parameters, methods, and attributes that your
component has.

The name of the class should be in CamelCase, and should make sense when used in
the sentence: "A (component-name) is a...".

This docstring is written in ReStructuredText and will be parsed by
`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_
to make the API documentation.
`Here is information <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_
about how ReStructuredText works.

Recommendations on coding style
-------------------------------
- Please stick to the coding style described by
  `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.
- Also read `PEP 257 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_
  which describes general python docstring conventions.
- Class and function docstrings should follow the
  `numpydoc conventions <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt>`_.
- See the :ref:`Standard Naming conventions <component_standard_names>` for
  good practice on parameters and variables naming.
- If you have any questions about the process after you have finished reading the
  documentation, consider making an
  `Issue <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues/new/>`_
  to ask the development team for help.

Examples
--------
The next line is a line of code! after three >>>s and a space are lines that
will be evaluated in tests. It is also helpful for users. Use this space to give
an overall example of using your component.

>>> from landlab import RasterModelGrid
>>> from landlab.components import ComponentMaker
>>> mg = RasterModelGrid((3,3))
>>> cm = ComponentMaker(mg, spam=True, eggs=1.0)
>>> cm.spam
True
>>> cm.eggs
1.0
>>> 'component_maker__field' in mg.at_node
True
>>> cm.run_one_step(dt=100)
