class PotentialityFlowRouter(Component):
    """Multidirectional flow routing using a novel method.

    This class implements Voller, Hobley, and Paola's experimental matrix
    solutions for flow routing. The method works by solving for a potential
    field at all nodes on the grid, which enforces both mass conservation
    and flow downhill along topographic gradients. It is order n and highly
    efficient, but does not return any information about flow connectivity.

    Options are permitted to allow "abstract" routing (flow enforced downslope,
    but no particular assumptions are made about the governing equations), or
    routing according to the Chezy or Manning equations. This routine assumes
    that water is distributed evenly over the surface of the cell in deriving
    the depth, and does not assume channelization. You will need to back-
    calculate channel depths for yourself using known widths at each node
    if that is what you want.

    It is VITAL you initialize this component AFTER setting boundary
    conditions.

    If Manning or Chezy specified, the surface_water__depth is the depth of
    flow in the cell, calculated assuming flow occurs over the whole surface.

    Note that this component offers the property `discharges_at_links`. This
    returns the discharges at all links. If method=='D8', this list will
    include diagonal links after the orthogonal links, which is why this
    information is not returned as a field.

    Discharges at nodes are recorded as the outgoing total discharge (i.e.,
    including any contribution from 'water__unit_flux_in').

    The primary method of this class is :func:`run_one_step`.
