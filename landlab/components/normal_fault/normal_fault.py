"""Rock uplift along a normal fault.

Landlab component that implements rock uplift by a normal fault. Note that this
component does not make any attempt to advect topography laterally.

    """NormalFault implements relative rock motion due to a normal fault.

    The fault can have an arbitrary trace given by two points (x1, y1) and
    (x2, y2) in the `fault_trace` input parameter. These value of these points
    is in model-space coordinates and is not based on node id values or number
    of rows and columns.

    This NormalFault component permits two primary methods for enacting fault
    motion.

    1) **run_one_step**: The throw rate is provided through the
    ``fault_throw_rate_through_time`` parameter. This rate can be constant or
    arbitrary. See the NormalFault tutorial in the landlab tutorials repository
    for an extensive example. In this case, the NormalFault component will keep
    track of the cumulative amount of model-run-time and set the rate based on
    interpolating the provided rate-time history. *NOTE: this means that the
    model run timesteps must align with the time-rate relationship provided to
    NormalFault*. Improving this is on the developers todo list but is of low
    priority.

    2) **run_one_earthquake**: A single uplift event of size dz can be
    specified by this method. If NormalFault is used in this way, any
    specifications provided in the ``fault_throw_rate_through_time`` keyword
    argument will be ignored.

    Note that the NormalFault component does not prevent a user from combining
    the **run_one_step** and **run_one_earthquake** methods. It is encumbent
    upon the user, however, to ensure that these two methods are used in
    combination correctly for their specific use case.

        Instantiation of a NormalFault.

        Parameters
        --------
        grid : ModelGrid
        faulted_surface : str or list of str
            Surface that is modified by the NormalFault component. Must be a
            field name or a list of field names if the fault should uplift more
            than one field. Default value is `topographic__elevation`.
            If the faulted surface does not yet exist, it will be ingored. The
            ``run_one_step`` method will check to see an ignored field has been
            added and if it has been, it will modify it.
        fault_throw_rate_through_time : dict, optional
            Dictionary that specifies the time varying throw rate on the fault.
            Expected format is:
            ``fault_throw_rate_through_time = {'time': array, 'rate': array}``
            Default value is a constant rate of 0.001 (units not specified).
            This is acomplished by providing the dictionary
            ``{'time': [0], 'rate': [0.001]}``. NormalFault uses numpy interp
            to interpolate the time and rate pattern to the current model time.
            This function uses the first value for all values less than the
            first, and the last value for all values greater than the last, and
            thus providing only one number results in all times getting a rate
            of that value.
        fault_dip_angle : float, optional
            Dip angle of the fault in degrees.  Default value is 90 degrees.
        fault_trace : dictionary, optional
            Dictionary that specifies the coordinates of two locations on the
            fault trace. Expected format is
            ``fault_trace = {'x1': float,
                             'y1': float,
                             'x2': float,
                             'y2': float}``
            where the vector from ``(x1, y1)`` to ``(x2, y2)`` defines the
            strike of the fault trace. The orientation of the fault dip relative
            to the strike follows the right hand rule.
            Default is for the fault to strike NE.
        include_boundaries : boolean, optional
            Flag to indicate if model grid boundaries should be uplifted. If
            set to ``True`` uplifted model grid boundaries will be set to the
            average value of their upstream nodes. Default value is False.

        Examples
        --------

        Create a grid on which we will run the NormalFault component.

        >>> from landlab import RasterModelGrid
        >>> from landlab.components import NormalFault
        >>> grid = RasterModelGrid((6, 6), xy_spacing=10)

        Add an elevation field.

        >>> z = grid.add_zeros('node', 'topographic__elevation')


        Set the parameter values for the NormalFault component.

        >>> param_dict = {'faulted_surface': 'topographic__elevation',
        ...               'fault_dip_angle': 90.0,
        ...               'fault_throw_rate_through_time': {'time': [0, 9, 10],
        ...                                                 'rate': [0, 0, 0.05]},
        ...               'fault_trace': {'y1': 0,
        ...                                    'x1': 0,
        ...                                    'y2': 30,
        ...                                    'x2': 60},
        ...              'include_boundaries': False}

        Instantiate a NormalFault component.

        >>> nf = NormalFault(grid, **param_dict)
        >>> nf.faulted_nodes.reshape(grid.shape)
        array([[False, False, False, False, False, False],
               [False,  True, False, False, False, False],
               [False,  True,  True,  True, False, False],
               [False,  True,  True,  True,  True, False],
               [False,  True,  True,  True,  True, False],
               [False, False, False, False, False, False]], dtype=bool)

        As we can see, only a subset of the nodes have been identified as
        *faulted nodes*. Because we have set include_boundaries' to False none
        of the boundary nodes are faulted nodes.

        Next we will run the NormalFault for 30 1-year timesteps.

        >>> dt = 1.0
        >>> for i in range(30):
        ...     nf.run_one_step(dt)
        >>> z.reshape(grid.shape)
        array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
               [ 0.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
               [ 0.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  0.,  0.],
               [ 0.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  0.],
               [ 0.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  0.],
               [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.]])

        This results in uplift of the faulted nodes, as we would expect.

        If the user knows how much uplift (dz) they want to occur in an event,
        they can use the **run_one_earthquake** function with a specified dz.
        In this case fault_throw_rate_through_time will be ignored.

        >>> nf.run_one_earthquake(dz=100)
        >>> z.reshape(grid.shape)
        array([[   0.,    0.,    0.,    0.,    0.,    0.],
               [   0.,  101.,    0.,    0.,    0.,    0.],
               [   0.,  101.,  101.,  101.,    0.,    0.],
               [   0.,  101.,  101.,  101.,  101.,    0.],
               [   0.,  101.,  101.,  101.,  101.,    0.],
               [   0.,    0.,    0.,    0.,    0.,    0.]])

        Next, we make a very simple landscape model. We need a few components
        and we will set include_boundaries to True.

        >>> from landlab.components import FastscapeEroder, FlowAccumulator
        >>> grid = RasterModelGrid((6, 6), xy_spacing=10)
        >>> z = grid.add_zeros('node', 'topographic__elevation')
        >>> param_dict = {'faulted_surface': 'topographic__elevation',
        ...               'fault_dip_angle': 90.0,
        ...               'fault_throw_rate_through_time': {'time': [0, 900, 1000],
        ...                                                 'rate': [0, 0, 0.05]},

        ...                                    'x2': 60},
        ...              'include_boundaries': True}

        >>> nf = NormalFault(grid, **param_dict)
        >>> fr = FlowAccumulator(grid)
        >>> fs = FastscapeEroder(grid, K_sp=0.01)

        Run this model for 300 100-year timesteps.

        >>> dt = 100.0
        >>> for i in range(300):
        ...     nf.run_one_step(dt)
        ...     fr.run_one_step()
        ...     fs.run_one_step(dt)
        >>> z.reshape(grid.shape).round(decimals=2)
        array([[  0.  ,   0.  ,   0.  ,   0.  ,   0.  ,   0.  ],
               [  5.  ,   5.  ,   0.  ,   0.  ,   0.  ,   0.  ],
               [  7.39,   7.38,   2.38,   2.89,   0.  ,   0.  ],
               [  9.36,  11.43,   5.51,   6.42,   3.54,   3.54],
               [ 15.06,  15.75,  10.6 ,  11.42,   8.54,   8.54],
               [ 15.06,  15.06,  10.7 ,  11.42,   8.54,   8.54]])

        The faulted nodes have been uplifted and eroded! Note that here the
        boundary nodes are also uplifted.

        If a user chooses to set a rate-time pattern, but not run NormalFault
        along with all other components, then NormalFault's internal
        time-keeping will be incorrect.

        For example, if a user wanted to only run NormalFault every tenth
        timestep (or some more seismogenically reasonable set of times).

        >>> grid = RasterModelGrid((6, 6), xy_spacing=10)
        >>> z = grid.add_zeros('node', 'topographic__elevation')
        >>> nf = NormalFault(grid, **param_dict)
        >>> fr = FlowAccumulator(grid)
        >>> fs = FastscapeEroder(grid, K_sp=0.01)
        >>> model_time = 0.0
        >>> dt = 100.0
        >>> for i in range(300):
        ...     if i%10 == 0:
        ...         nf.run_one_step(dt, current_time = model_time)
        ...     fr.run_one_step()
        ...     fs.run_one_step(dt)
        ...     model_time += dt
        >>> model_time
        30000.0
        >>> nf.current_time
        29100.0

        This may seem incorrect as the model time and the current time are not
        the same. However, this is correct as the NormalFault runs one step only
        at the first of each 10 timesteps. The value of 2910.0 reflects that
        NormalFault ran from model time 29000.0 to 29100.0 and has not run since
        which is what we'd expect.
