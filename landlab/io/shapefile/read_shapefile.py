    """Read shapefile and create a NetworkModelGrid.

    There are a number of assumptions that are requied about the shapefile.
        * The shape file must be a polyline shapefile.
        * All polylines must be their own object (e.g. no multi-part
          polylines).
        * Polyline endpoints match perfectly.

    You might notice that there is no ``write_shapefile`` function. If this is
    something you need for your work, please make a GitHub issue to start this
    process.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file: str or file-like
        File path or file-like of a valid polyline shapefile
    dbf: file-like, optional
        If file is file-like, the dbf must also be passed.
    store_polyline_vertices: bool, optional
        If True (default), store the vertices of the polylines in
        the at_link fields ``x_of_polyline`` and ``y_of_polyline``.
    points_shapefile: str or file-like
        File path or file-like of a valid point shapefile.
    points_dbf: file-like, optional
        If file is file-like, the dbf must also be passed.
    link_fields: list, optional
        List of polyline shapefile attributes to import as landlab at-link
        fields. Default is to import all.
    node_fields: list, optional
        List of point shapefile attributes to import as landlab at-node
        fields. Default is to import all.
    link_field_conversion: dict, optional
        Dictionary mapping polyline shapefile field names to desired at link
        field names. Default is no remapping.
    node_field_conversion: dict, optional
        Dictionary mapping node shapefile field names to desired at node field
        names. Default is no remapping.
    link_field_dtype: dict, optional
        Dictionary mapping node shapefile field names to desired dtype. Default
        is no change to dtype.
    node_field_dtype: dict, optional
        Dictionary mapping node shapefile field names to desired dtype. Default
        is no change to dtype.
    threshold: float, optional
        Maximum distance between a point in the point shapefile and a polyline
        junction in the polyline shapefile. Units are the same as in the
        shapefiles. Default is zero (requiring perfect overlap).

    Returns
    -------
    grid : NetworkModelGrid instance
        The network model grid will have nodes at the endpoints of the
        polylines, and links that connect these nodes. Any fields
        associated with the shapefile will be added as at-link fields. If a
        point shapefile is provided those values will be added as at-node
        fields.

    Examples
    --------
    First, we make a simple shapefile

    >>> from io import BytesIO
    >>> import shapefile
    >>> shp = BytesIO()
    >>> shx = BytesIO()
    >>> dbf = BytesIO()
    >>> w = shapefile.Writer(shp=shp, shx=shx, dbf=dbf)
    >>> w.shapeType = shapefile.POLYLINE
    >>> w.field("spam", "N")
    >>> w.line([[[5,5],[10,10]]])
    >>> w.record(37)
    >>> w.line([[[5,0],[5,5]]])
    >>> w.record(100)
    >>> w.line([[[5,5],[0,10]]])
    >>> w.record(239)
    >>> w.close()

    Now create a NetworkModelGrid with read_shapefile:

    >>> from landlab.io import read_shapefile
    >>> grid = read_shapefile(shp, dbf=dbf)
    >>> grid.nodes
    array([0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> grid.x_of_node
    array([  5.,   5.,   0.,  10.])
    >>> grid.y_of_node
    array([  0.,   5.,  10.,  10.])
    >>> grid.nodes_at_link
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 1],
           [1, 3]])
    >>> assert "spam" in grid.at_link
    >>> grid.at_link["spam"]
    array([100, 239, 37])

    Next lets also include a points file. First create both shapefiles.

    >>> shp = BytesIO()
    >>> shx = BytesIO()
    >>> dbf = BytesIO()
    >>> w = shapefile.Writer(shp=shp, shx=shx, dbf=dbf)
    >>> w.shapeType = shapefile.POLYLINE
    >>> w.field("spam", "N")
    >>> w.line([[[5,5],[10,10]]])
    >>> w.record(37)
    >>> w.line([[[5,0],[5,5]]])
    >>> w.record(100)
    >>> w.line([[[5,5],[0,10]]])
    >>> w.record(239)
    >>> w.close()

    >>> p_shp = BytesIO()
    >>> p_shx = BytesIO()
    >>> p_dbf = BytesIO()
    >>> p_w = shapefile.Writer(shp=p_shp, shx=p_shx, dbf=p_dbf)
    >>> p_w.shapeType = shapefile.POINT
    >>> p_w.field("eggs", "N")
    >>> p_w.point(5, 0)
    >>> p_w.record(2)
    >>> p_w.point(5, 5)
    >>> p_w.record(4)
    >>> p_w.point(0, 10)
    >>> p_w.record(8)
    >>> p_w.point(10, 10)
    >>> p_w.record(6)
    >>> p_w.close()

    Now read in both files together.

    >>> grid = read_shapefile(shp,dbf=dbf,points_shapefile=p_shp,points_dbf=p_dbf)
    >>> grid.nodes
    array([0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> grid.x_of_node
    array([  5.,   5.,   0.,  10.])
    >>> grid.y_of_node
    array([  0.,   5.,  10.,  10.])
    >>> grid.nodes_at_link
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 1],
           [1, 3]])
    >>> assert "spam" in grid.at_link
    >>> grid.at_link["spam"]
    array([100, 239, 37])
    >>> assert "eggs" in grid.at_node
    >>> grid.at_node["eggs"]
    array([2, 4, 8, 6])
