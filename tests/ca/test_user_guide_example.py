test_user_guide_example.py

This test checks the example presented in the CellLab-CTS User Guide. If this
test fails as part of a compatibility-breaking major version update, the
corresponding code in the User Guide should also be updated. Some limits:
    - plotting is not tested (commented out here)
    - main is renamed here
    - run_duration is reduced to speed up test

def setup_transition_list():
    """
    Creates and returns a list of Transition() objects to represent state
    transitions for an unbiased random walk.

    Parameters
    ----------
    (none)

    Returns
    -------
    xn_list : list of Transition objects
        List of objects that encode information about the link-state transitions.

    Notes
    -----
    State 0 represents fluid and state 1 represents a particle (such as a
    sediment grain, tea leaf, or solute molecule).

    The states and transitions are as follows:

    Pair state      Transition to       Process             Rate (cells/s)
    ==========      =============       =======             ==============
