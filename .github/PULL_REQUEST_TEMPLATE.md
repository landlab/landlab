### Checklist - did you ...

<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution
     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.

    Tests are required for bugfixes and new features. Documentation changes
    are necessary for formatting and most enhancement changes.

    Ensure proper code formatting with black. You can do this by running
    black from landlab's top-level folder.

    Ensure landlab is lint-free by running flake8 at landlab's top-level
    folder.

    If you like, you can automate these tasks by installing pre-commit hooks.
    This is done by running `pre-commit install` at landlab's top-level
    folder.
