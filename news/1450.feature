Added a new class of grid, *FramedVoronoiGrid* which is an elaborated version of the VoronoiDelaunayGrid. The user input parameters to automatically calculate the positions of the nodes. The boundary nodes are automatically fixed, in a not random way. The core nodes are first positioned in a rectangular pattern, and then moved by a random distance in such a way that a minimal distance between nodes is respected. This minimal distance is convenient when we have to run diffusion or river incision processes on the grid, which can become unstable for two small distances between nodes (depending on the timestep of the run).
