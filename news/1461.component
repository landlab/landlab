Creates ``FlowRouter``, a component which directs flow and handles depressions simultaneously for performance and scalability purposes. Compatible with all types of grids. It also calculates flows. A notebook ``flow_direction_and_accumulation\depression_handling.ipynb`` describes the use of ``Flowrouter``, notably with multiple other flow routers, and compares the results with the use of ``DepressionFinder``.
