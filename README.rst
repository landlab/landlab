What does Landlab do?
---------------------

Landlab is an open-source Python-language package for numerical modeling of
Earth surface dynamics. It contains

* A gridding engine which represents the model domain. Regular and irregular
  grids are supported.
* A library of process components, each of which represents a physical process
  (e.g., generation of rain, erosion by flowing water). These components have
  a common interface and can be combined based on a user's needs.
* Utilities that support general numerical methods, file input/output, and
  visualization.

In addition Landlab contains a set of Jupyter notebook tutorials providing
an introduction to core concepts and examples of use.

Landlab was designed for disciplines that quantify Earth surface dynamics such
as geomorphology, hydrology, glaciology, and stratigraphy. It can also be used
in related fields. Scientists who use this type of model often build
their own unique model from the ground up, re-coding the basic building blocks
of their landscape model rather than taking advantage of codes that have
already been written. Landlab saves practitioners from the need for this kind
of re-invention by providing standardized components that they can re-use.

at CSDMS to learn more.

How do I install Landlab?
-------------------------

First you'll need a Python distribution and either the conda or pip package
manager. If you don't know what you want, we recommend the Anaconda Python
distribution.

Two main installation options exist for Landlab. Most people will likely want
to
`install a prepackaged binary <https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/index.html>`_.
We distribute through both conda-forge and pip.

Landlab 2.0
```````````

In late December 2019 Landlab switched to version 2.0-beta. Landlab will be
in 2.0-beta until the Landlab 2.0 publication is finalized. Landlab dropped
support of Python 2.7 with this transition.

Supported Python Versions
`````````````````````````

Landlab supports Python versions >= 3.6. Landlab distributes pre-packaged
binaries through `conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/landlab>`_
and `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/landlab/>`_ for versions 3.6 and 3.7
(3.8 coming soon). 

Conda Environment with Pre-packaged Binary Distribution
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````

To create a conda environment that installs a pre-packaged binary and all the
dependencies necessary to run the notebooks, clone the repository, navigate to
within the top level directory and use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda env create --file=environment.yml

Then activate the environment and open the welcome notebook execute the
following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda activate landlab_notebooks
    $ jupyter notebook notebooks/welcome.ipynb

Developer Installation
``````````````````````

Individuals interested in modifying the Landlab source code should follow the
`developer installation instructions <https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/install/index.html>`_
which describe cloning the source code, creating a conda environment for
development, compiling, and testing the code.

In short, clone the repository, navigate to the top level directory, and
the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda env create --file=environment-dev.yml
    $ conda activate landlab_dev
    $ python setup.py develop

How do I verify I've installed Landlab correctly?
-------------------------------------------------

Landlab uses pytest to discover and run tests. These include docstring tests
located within the core source code (``landlab\landlab`` directory) and unit
tests located within the ``landlab\tests`` directory. Presuming you have used a
source code installation with the above conda environment, you will be able to
test your install with

.. code-block::

    $ pytest

from within the ``landlab_dev`` conda environment. Additional instructions,
including how the unit tests directory is structured can be found under the
`testing section`_ of the landlab documentation.

.. _testing section: https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/development/install/test.html

What are Landlab's dependencies?
--------------------------------

The core package dependencies are specified by ``requirements.txt`` and used
by ``setup.py``. There are some additional dependencies that exist for
running the notebooks or modifying the source code and testing.

Details of how we structure our dependencies can be found under the
`dependencies section`_ of the landlab documentation.

.. _dependencies section: https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/development/practices/dependencies.html

How do I learn more about Landlab?
----------------------------------

Our documentation is hosted on ReadTheDocs at https://landlab.readthedocs.io/.
This includes a User Guide and API reference.

The following paper describes the design of Landlab.

Are there any examples of using Landlab I can look at?
------------------------------------------------------

The Landlab package contains a directory at ``landlab/notebooks`` which contains
Jupyter notebooks describe core concepts and give examples of using components.
The file ``landlab/notebooks/welcome.ipynb`` provides a table of contents to
the notebooks and is the recommended starting place. To launch an instance of
Binder and `explore the notebooks click here`_.

.. _explore the notebooks click here: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/welcome.ipynb

In addition there are a set of notebooks curated to teach physical processes
located in the directory ``landlab/notebooks/teaching``.

To launch an Binder instance that goes straight to these `teaching notebooks click here`_.
