	abstract = {In this paper a semi-implicit finite difference model for non-hydrostatic, free-surface flows is analyzed and discussed. It is shown that the present algorithm is generally more accurate than recently developed models for quasi-hydrostatic flows. The governing equations are the free-surface Navier – Stokes equations defined on a general, irregular domain of arbitrary scale. The momentum equations, the incompressibility condition and the equation for the free-surface are integrated by a semi-implicit algorithm in such a fashion that the resulting numerical solution is mass conservative and unconditionally stable with respect to the gravity wave speed, wind stress, vertical viscosity and bottom friction.

The root-mean-square differences between theforecasts are calculated in order to measure the sensitivity of the predictions to thesize of the time step. These experiments show that the truncation errors remain reasonably small with time steps as large as two hours.},
