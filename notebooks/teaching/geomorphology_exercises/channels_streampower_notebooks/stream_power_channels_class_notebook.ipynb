    "**What is this notebook?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the evolution of detachment-limited channels in an actively uplifting landscape. The landscape evolves according to the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " \\frac{d z}{d t} = -K_\\text{sp} A^{m_{sp}} S^{n_{sp}} + U\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Here, $K_{sp}$ is the erodibility coefficient on fluvial incision, which is thought to be positively correlated with climate wetness, or storminess (this is hard to quantify) and to be negatively correlated with rock strength (again, rock strength is hard to quantify). $m_{sp}$ and $n_{sp}$ are positive exponents, usually thought to have a ratio, $m_{sp}/n_{sp} \\approx 0.5$. $A$ is drainage area and $S$ is the slope of steepest descent ($-\\frac{dz}{dx}$) where $x$ is horizontal distance (positive in the downslope direction) and $z$ is elevation. (If slope is negative there is no fluvial erosion.) $U$ is an externally-applied rock uplift field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fluvial erosion term is also known as the stream power equation. Before using this notebook you should be familiar with this equation from class lectures and reading. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a great overview of the stream power equation, see: \n",

    "\n",
    "**What will you do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will modify the code to get a better understanding of how rock uplift rates and patterns and the erodibility coefficient control fluvial channel form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start at the top by reading each block of text and sequentially running each code block (shift - enter OR got to the _Cell_ pulldown menu at the top and choose _Run Cells_). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you just change one code block and rerun only that code block, only the parts of the code in that code block will be updated. (E.g. if you change parameters but don't reset the code blocks that initialize run time or topography, then these values will not be reset.) \n",

    "1. What do you think will happen to total relief (defined as the maximum minus the minimum elevation, here area is fixed) and channel slope at steady state if $K_{sp}$ is uniformly increased?\n",
    "2. What do you think will happen to total relief and channel slope at steady state if $U$ is uniformly increased?\n",
    "3. How do you think a steady-state landscape with a uniform low rock uplift rate will respond if rock uplift is uniformly increased (relative to a steady base level)? How will channel slopes change through time?"

    "Answer the following questions using the code above and below. All answers should be typed, and supporting figures (produced using the code) should be embedded in one document that you hand in. Code Blocks 8-12 and 18-21 produce different figures that you may find useful. You can use any or all of these different figures to help you with the questions below. (Download or screenshoot the figures.) \n",

    "Anything with a question mark should be answered in the document that you hand in. Make sure your write in full sentences and proofread the document that you hand in.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Steady state with low uplift rate. ** Using the parameters provided in the initial notebook, run the landscape to steady state. (Note that you can keep running the main evolution loop - Code Block 7 - and the different plotting blocks without running the code blocks above them. You may also want to change $tmax$ in Code Block 4.) How did you know that the landscape reached steady state? Note the approximate time that it took to reach steady state for your own reference. (This will be usefull for later questions.) Include appropriate plots. (If you want to analyze these landscapes outside of Landlab or save for later, make sure you save the elevation data to a text file (Code Block 13).)\n",
    "\n",
    "** NOTE, For the rest of the questions you should use Code Blocks 14 - 21. These will allow you to use the steady-state landscape created for question 1 - referred to here as the 'base landscape' - as the initial condition. Start by editing what you need to in Code Blocks 14 - 16. Run these each once, sequentially. You can run Code Block 17, the time loop, as many times as you need to, along with Code Blocks 18-21, which produce plots.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Transient landscape responding to an increase in rock uplift. ** Use the base landscape and increase rock uplift uniformly by a factor of 4 to 0.0004 m/yr. Make sure you update the rock uplift rate (Code Block 16) and ensure that $tmax$ is 1e5 yrs and $dt$ is 500 yrs (Code Block 15). Run this until the maximum elevation in the grid is ~ 170 m and observe how the landscape gets to this elevation, i.e. plot intermediate steps. What patterns do you see in the supporting plots that illustrate this type of transient? Which patterns, if any, are diagnostic of a landscape response to uniform increase in rock uplift rate? (You may need to answer this after completing all of the questions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ** Steady-state landscape with increased rock uplift. ** Now run the landscape from question 2 until it reaches steady state. (I.e. run the time loop, Code Block 17, a bunch of times. You can increase $tmax$ and $dt$ to make this run faster.) Provide a plot that illustrates that the landscape is in steady state. What aspects of the landscape have changed in comparison with the base landscape from question 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ** Increase erodibility. ** Start again from the base landscape, but this time increase $K_{sp}$ to 2E-5 (Code Block 14). Make sure rock uplift rate is set to the original value of 0.0001 m/yr (Code Block 16). Set $tmax$ to 1e5 yrs (Code Block 15). Run for 1e5 yrs and save the plots that you think are diagnostic. Run for another 1e5 yrs and save plots again. Now run for 5e5 yrs and save plots again. Quantitatively describe how the landscape evolves in response to the increase in erodibility and provide supporting plots. What could cause a uniform increase in erodibility?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ** Spatially varible uplift - discrete, massive earthquake. ** Start again from the base landscape, and make sure that $K_{sp}$ = 1E-5 (Code Block 14). Now add a seismic event to this steady state landscape - a fault that runs horizontally across the landscape at y = 4000 m, and instantaneously uplifts half the landscape by 10 meters (Code Block 16). In this case, we will keep background uplift uniform at 0.0001 m/yr. Set $tmax$ to 1e5 yrs and $dt$ to 500 yrs (Code Block 15) before evolving the landscape after the fault. Now run the time loop four times and look at the different plots after each loop. How does the landscape respond to this fault? What patterns do you see in the supporting plots that illustrate this type of transient? Which patterns, if any, are diagnostic of a channel response to an earthquake? (You may need to answer this after completing all of the questions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. ** Spatially Varible Rock Uplift - discrete fault with two different uplift rates. ** Start again from the base landscape, and make sure that $K_{sp}$ = 1E-5 (Code Block 14). Now we will add a fault (at y = 4000 m) to this landscape. In this case the uplift rate on the footwall is higher (0.0004 m/yr) than on the hanging wall (uplift rate = 0.0001 m/yr). (Edit Code Block 16.) Set $tmax$ to 1e5 yrs and $dt$ to 500 yrs (Code Block 15). Now run the time loop four separate times and look at the different plots after each loop. How does the landscape respond to this fault? What patterns do you see in the supporting plots that illustrate this type of transient? Which patterns, if any, are diagnostic of a channel response to a this type of gradient in rock uplift rates? (You may need to answer this after completing all of the questions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. ** Spatially Varible Rock Uplift - gradient in uplift across the range. ** Start again from the base landscape, and make sure that $K_{sp}$ = 1E-5 (Code Block 14). Now we will add a linear gradient in uplift rate across the entire range (edit Code Block 16). The maximum uplift rate will be 0.0004 m/yr at the core of the range, and 0.0001 m/yr at the front of the range. Set $tmax$ to 1e5 yrs (Code Block 4) and $dt$ to 500 yrs before you start running the time loop for the fault before you start running the time loop with the rock uplift gradient. Now run the time loop four separate times and look at the different plots after each loop. How does the landscape respond to this gradient in uplift rate? What patterns do you see in the supporting plots that illustrate this type of transient? Which patterns, if any, are diagnostic of a channel response to this type of gradient in rock uplift rates? (You may need to answer this after completing all of the questions.)\n",
