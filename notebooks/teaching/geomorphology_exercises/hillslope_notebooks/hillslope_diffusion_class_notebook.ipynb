    "**What is this notebook?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the evolution of landforms dominated by processes that result in linear diffusion of sediment. In other words, the downhill flow of soil is proportional to the (downhill) gradient of the land surface multiplied by a transport coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook first illustrates a simple example of a diffusing hillslope. We then provide a number of exercises for students to do on their own. This set of exercises is recomended for students in a quantitative geomorphology class, who have been introduced to the linear diffusion equation in class. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Application of linear diffusion transport law:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For relatively gentle, soil-mantled slopes, there is reasonably strong support for a transport law of the form:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "q_s = -D \\nabla z\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where ${q}_s$ is the transport rate with dimensions of L$^2$T$^{-1}$;  $D$ is a transport coefficient with dimensions of L$^2$T$^{-1}$; and $z$ is elevation. $\\nabla z$ is the gradient in elevation. If distance is increasing downslope, $\\nabla z$ is negative downslope, hence the negative in front of $D$. \n",
    " \n",
    "Changes in elevation, or erosion, are calculated from conservation of mass:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{dz}{dt} = U-\\nabla q_s\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $U$ is the rock uplift rate, with dimensions LT$^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How will we explore this with Landlab?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Landlab component *LinearDiffuser*, which implements the equations above, to explore how hillslopes evolve when linear diffusion describes hillslope sediment transport. We will explore both steady state, here defined as erosion rate equal to rock uplift rate, and also how a landscape gets to steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example illustrates how to set-up the model and evolve a hillslope to steady state, along with how to plot some variables of interest. We assume that you have knowledge of how to derive the steady-state form of a uniformly uplifting, steady-state, diffusive hillslope. For more information on hillslope sediment transport laws, this paper is a great overview:\n",

    "Roering, Joshua J. (2008) \"How well can hillslope evolution models “explain” topography? Simulating soil transport and production with high-resolution topographic data.\" Geological Society of America Bulletin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the first example, you are asked to first think about what will happen as you change a parameter, and then you explore this numerically by changing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start at the top by reading each block of text and sequentially running each code block (shift - enter OR got to the _Cell_ pulldown menu at the top and choose _Run Cells_). \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you can always go to the _Kernel_ pulldown menu at the top and choose _Restart & Clear Output_ or _Restart & Run All_ if you change things and want to start afresh. If you just change one code block and rerun only that code block, only the parts of the code in that code block will be updated. (E.g. if you change parameters but don't reset the code blocks that initialize run time or topography, then these values will not be reset.) "

    "1. In the example illustrated here ($D$ = 0.01 m$^2$yr$^{-1}$ and $U$ = 0.0001 m yr$^{-1}$). Restart everything, and use the model to determine how long it takes for the landscape to go from a flat to reach 50%, 75% and 100% of its steady-state morphology. Does the landscape approach steady state linearly in time? (You can run the time loop (Code Block 7) multiple times without running other code blocks again to continually evolve the landscape. You will initially want to rerun all the code blocks and change the value of **run_time** (Code Block 4). Determining the correct value of **run_time** to use will take some iteration.)\n",
    "2. What do you think will happen when you increase $D$ (Code Block 3) by a factor of 10? Will the time to steady state differ? If yes, how? Will the topography be different? If yes, how and why? What does it mean physically, about processes, if $D$ increases? Answer these questions before running any code. \n",
    "3. Now set $D$ = 0.1 m$^2$yr$^{-1}$ and rerun landscape evolution from an initial flat. Illustrate the final steady state topography and record the time to steady state. Discuss how the landscape differs from the results in question 1. Discuss how the results are similar to or different from your intuition. It is OK if your intuition was wrong! \n",
    "4. What do you think will happen when you increase **uplift_rate** (Code Block 4) by a factor of 10? Will the time to steady state differ? If yes, how? Will the topography be different? If yes, how and why? Answer these questions first, and then rerun the code with **uplift_rate** = 0.001 m yr$^{-1}$. (Make sure you change $D$ - Code Block 3 - back to the original value of 0.01 m$^2$yr$^{-1}$ and restart from a flat surface.) Illustrate the final steady state topography. Discuss how these results differ from the results in question 1 and how the results match (or do not) your intuition. It is OK if your intuition was wrong.\n",
