    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the importance of watershed shape and rainfall intensity and duration on the characteristics of hydrographs. \n",
    "\n",
    "To clearly contrast landscape shape, this notebook uses two synthetic landscapes, or landscapes produced using a landscape evolution model. One landscape is square (length = width) and one is rectangular (length = 4*width). Both landscapes have a drainage area of 36 km$^2$ and a cell size of 30 m.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overland flow is modeled as a diffusive approximation of the shallow water equation. (If you do not understand what that means, you can still learn from this notebook.) No infiltration is modeled. Rain falls on the landscape and flows downhill, driving overland flow and a hydrograph at every location on the landscape. In this notebook, we track the hydrograph at three points in the watershed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using this notebook you should have learned about overland flow and a hydrograph. You should know the terms rainfall intensity and duration, as well as peak discharge, hydrograph time to peak, rising limb, and falling limb. For example, these concepts are covered in Chapter 10 of:\n",

    "\n",
    "The code used in this exercise is taken from the above Adams et al., (2017) reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What will you do?** \n",
    "\n",
    "You will run this model several times, changing the rainfall characteristics or watershed on which flow is routed. You will generate hydrographs and learn how different parameters affect hydrograph characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start at the top by reading each block of text and sequentially running each code block (put your curser in a code block and type shift - enter OR got to the _Cell_ pulldown menu at the top and choose _Run Cells_). \n",

    "**Questions to answer before running this notebook.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do you think that watershed shape affects hydrograph shape? Consider two watersheds, one that is square and one that is rectangular with a width to length ratio of 1 to 4. Both watersheds have the same drainage area. If the same amount of rain falls uniformly across each landscape, will it affect the time to peak and peak discharge at the outlet?\n",
    "2. Do you think that the rainfall intensity impacts the time to peak and peak discharge at a watershed outlet? If so, how?\n",
