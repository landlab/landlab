    "## Understanding the topology of Landlab grids\n",
    "\n",
    "All grids consist of two interlocked sets of *points* joined by *lines* outlining *areas*. If we define data on the points we call **nodes**, then they are joined by **links**, which outline **patches**. Each node within the interior of the grid lies at the geometric center of the area of a **cell**. The cell's edges are **faces**, and the endpoints of the faces---which are also vertices of the cells---are **corners**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this kind of scheme requires one set of features to be \"dominant\" over the other; i.e., either not every node has a cell, *or* not every link is crossed by a face. Both cannot be true, because one or other set of features has to define the edge of the grid. Landlab assumes that the node set is primary, so there are always more nodes than corners; more links than faces; and more patches than cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these sets of *\"elements\"* has its own set of IDs. These IDs are what allow us to index the various Landlab fields, which store spatial data. Each feature is ordered by **x, then y**. The origin is always at the bottom left node, unless you choose to move it (`grid.move_origin`)... except in the specific case of a radial grid, where logic and symmetry dictates it must be the central node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever Landlab needs to order something rotationally (angles; elements around a different element type), it does so following the standard mathematical convention of **counterclockwise from east**. We'll see this in practical terms a bit later in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final thing to know is that **links and faces have directions**. This lets us record fluxes on the grid by associating them with, and mapping them onto, the links (or, much less commonly, the faces). All lines point into the **upper right half-space**. So, on our raster, this means the horizontal links point east and the vertical links point north.\n",
