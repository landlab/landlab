    "Landlab grids consist of nodes (and other elements as cells, links, ...) which have 4 status. (1) Nodes that receives flow from other nodes and transfer flow to other nodes are **core** nodes. (2) and (3), Nodes that receive flow but don't transfer it are either **fixed value** or **fixed gradient**. These nodes form the base-level of the grid and can be outlets of the grid (and they can have different elevation depending on the location on the grid. (4) Nodes that neither receive nor transfer flow are **closed**.\n",

    "By default, all grids except VoronoiDelaunayGrid and NetworkModelGrid have their base-level defined at their **perimeter**, which is also called **boundary**. In other words, the perimeter nodes have the status fixed value. In the VoronoiDelaunayGrid, the perimeter nodes are also of fixed values but are not always exhaustively determined. This problem is linked to the method to catch the perimeter, which is not appropriate to all node distributions. The perimeter nodes of the NetworkModelGrid are by default all with status=core. So, if we choose VoronoiDelaunayGrid and NetworkModelGrid, it can be appropriate to specifically tell the code where the base-level nodes are, using the status fixed value and closed. Presently, the method to catch the perimeter nodes doesn't work on all VoronoiDelaunayGrids depending on the distribution of the nodes and for completely random VoronoiDelaunay grids, base-level nodes need to be redefined.\n",

    "While sinks can occur naturally, they can also be produced by DEM artefacts linked to their resolution. Additionally, on timescales larger than 1,000 years, depressions (with their sink as their lowest point) tend to be breached, but the erosion laws currently used might have difficulty to simulate this breaching. This gives ground to prefer to direct the flow outside of the depression, to ensure that all outlets of the grid are on the perimeter.\n",

The component then maps depressions and finds the lowest node at the perimeter of the depression. Once found, it considers this point as the depression outlet and recalculates all flow directions and accumulations by evacuating the depression."
