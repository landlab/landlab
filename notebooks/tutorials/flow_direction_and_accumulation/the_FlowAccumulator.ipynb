The default **FlowDirector** is **FlowDirectorSteepest**, which is the same as D4 in the special case of a raster grid. There are a few different ways to specify which **FlowDirector** you want **FlowAccumulator** to use. The next section will go over these options. \n",
    "\n",
    "**FlowAccumulator** can take a constant or spatially variable input called ```runoff_rate```, which it uses to calculate discharge. Alternatively, if there is an `at_node` field called ```water__unit_flux_in``` and no value is specified as the ```runoff_rate```, **FlowAccumulator** will use the values stored in ```water__unit_flux_in```.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to directing flow and accumulating it in one step, **FlowAccumulator** can also deal with depression finding internally. This can be done by passing a **DepressionFinder** to the keyword argument ```depression_finder```. The default behavior is to not deal with depressions internally. \n",

    "Finally, if the **FlowDirector** you are using takes any keyword arguments, those can be passed to the **FlowAccumulator**. For example, **FlowDirectorMFD** has to option to use diagonals in addition to links and to proportion flow based on either the slope or the the square root of slope."
