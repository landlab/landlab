    "# Comparison of FlowDirectors\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Landlab's topographic flow-routing capability directs flow and accumulates it using two types of components:\n",
    "\n",
    "**FlowDirectors** use the topography to determine how flow moves between adjacent nodes. For every node in the grid it determines the node(s) to receive flow, and the proportion of flow to send from one node to its receiver(s). \n",
    "\n",
    "The **FlowAccumulator** uses the direction and proportion of flow moving between each node and (optionally) water runoff to calculate drainage area and discharge. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **FlowDirectors** are method-specific. Presently landlab supports four different methods for determining flow direction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FlowDirectorSteepest** Flow is routed to only one node. The algorithm considers the link slopes leaving from each node and chooses the steepest downhill link to route flow along. In the case of a raster grid, only the links are considered (Landlab differentiates between *links*, which never cross and are located at North, South, East, and West on a raster grid, and *diagonals* which cross and are located at North East, North West, South East, and South West). For raster grids, this method is also known as D4 flow routing. In the case of irregular grids, all links originating from a node are consideded.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **FlowDirectorD8** (raster only) Flow is only routed to one node but diagonals are also considered. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **FlowDirectorMFD** Flow is directed to all nodes that are located downhill of the source node. In the case of a raster grid, diagonals can be included using the keyword ```diagonals=True```. Flow is partitioned between receiver nodes based on the relative slope along the links leading to the receiver nodes. The default method for partitioning is based on the sum of receiver slopes (```partition_method='slope'```). Partitioning can also be done on the basis of the square root of slope, which gives the result of a steady kinematic wave(```partition_method='square_root_of_slope'```).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **FlowDirectorDINF** (raster only) Flow is directed to two cells based on the slope of the triangular facets that can be defined between a node and its neighbors. The steepest downhill facet is chosen and then flow is partitioned between the receiver nodes at the bottom of that facet based on the relative slopes along the facet-bounding links. (The method, known as \"D-infinity\", is described by Tarboton (1997, Water Resources Research, 33(2), 309-319)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will go over more detailed examples that contrast the differences between each flow-direction algorithm. For information about how to initialize and run a **FlowDirector** or the **FlowAccumulator**, refer to the other tutorials in this section. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we import the necessary python modules and make a small plotting routine. "
