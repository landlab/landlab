Inputs to the component can be fed in as arguments to the constructor (i.e., the function that gets called when you create a new instances of a component), rather than being fed in as strings from a text input file (though note, you an still do this, see below). This has two major advantages: firstly, components now have plainly declared default values, which are visible just as they would be in, say, a numpy function; secondly, because the inputs are now Python objects, it's a lot easier to work with spatially variable inputs that need to be passed in as arrays, and also to feed dynamically changing inputs into a component.\n",

Note that nothing is returned from a run method like this, but that nonetheless *the grid fields are updated*.\n",
