    "# Using the HackCalculator Component\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Hack's Law refers to a commonly observed power-law relationship between the length of the longest stream in a drainage basin, $L$, and the area that it drains, $A$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L = C A^h$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h$ is commonly in the neighborhood of 0.5 or 0.6. It is named for the American geomorphologist John Hack (see Hack, 1957). A value of 0.5 represents perfect geometry similarity between the areal measure, $A$, and the embedded length $L$. Montgomery and Dietrich (1992) noted a useful \"rule of thumb\" empirical relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A \\approx \\frac{1}{3} L^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which says that, roughly speaking, the surface area of a typical drainage basin is on the order of 1/3 times the square of its longest stream length. But individual drainage basins often deviate somewhat from this idealized behavior, and often it is useful to extract the values of $C$ and $h$ for particular basins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Component overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `HackCalculator` provides estimates of the best-fit $C$ and $h$ values for one or more drainage basins within a given area represented by a digital elevation model, which is contained in a grid field called `topographic__elevation`. The component requires a grid that includes the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `topographic__elevation` (node) elevation data for the region of interest\n",
    "- `drainage_area` (node) contributing drainage area for each node\n",
    "- `flow__receiver_node` (node) ID of the receiver (node that receives flow) for each node\n",
    "- `flow__link_to_receiver_node` (node) ID of the link connecting node and receiver for each node\n",
    "- `flow__upstream_node_order` (node) array of node IDs in downstream-to-upstream order\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from `topographic__elevation`, each of these fields are created and calculated by running the `FlowAccumulator` component.\n",
    "\n",
    "The component uses the `ChannelProfiler` component to calculate cumulative downstream length for one or more channels in the terrain. Parameters for the `ChannelProfiler` may be given as arguments to `HackCalculator`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When run (using the method `calculate_hack_parameters`), the component creates a Pandas DataFrame called `hack_coefficient_dataframe`. It is a pandas dataframe with one row for each basin for which Hack parameters are calculated. Thus, there are as many rows as the number of watersheds identified by the ChannelProfiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataframe has the following index and columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Index\n",
    "     - **basin_outlet_id**: The node ID of the watershed outlet where each set of Hack parameters was estimated.\n",
    "- Columns\n",
    "     - **A_max**: The drainage area of the watershed outlet.\n",
    "     - **C**: The Hack coefficient as defined in the equations above.\n",
    "     - **h**: The Hack exponent as defined in the equations above.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you pass the argument `save_full_df=True`, `HackCalculator` will generate an additional DataFrame called `full_hack_dataframe`. It is pandas dataframe with a row for every model grid cell used to estimate the Hack parameters. It has the following index and columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Index\n",
    "    - **node_id**: The node ID of the model grid cell.\n",
    "- Columns\n",
    "     - **basin_outlet_id**: The node IDs of watershed outlet\n",
    "     - **A**: The drainage are of the model grid cell.\n",
    "     - **L_obs**: The observed distance to the divide.\n",
    "     - **L_est**: The predicted distance to divide based on the Hack coefficient fit.\n"

    "\n",
    "In this example, we read in a small digital elevation model (DEM) from NASADEM for an area on the Colorado high plains (USA) that includes a portion of an escarpment along the west side of a drainage known as West Bijou Creek (see Rengers & Tucker, 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "The DEM file is in ESRI Ascii format, but is in a geographic projection, with horizontal units of decimal degrees. To calculate slope gradients properly, we'll first read the DEM into a Landlab grid object that has this geographic projection. Then we'll create a second grid with 30 m cell spacing (approximately equal to the NASADEM's resolution), and copy the elevation field from the geographic DEM. This isn't a proper projection of course, but it will do for purposes of this example."
