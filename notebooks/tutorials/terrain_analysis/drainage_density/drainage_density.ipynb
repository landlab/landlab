    "# Using the DrainageDensity Component\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Drainage density is defined as the total map-view length of stream channels, $\\Lambda$, within a region with map-view surface area $A$, divided by that area:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D_d = \\Lambda / A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The measure has dimensions of inverse length. The traditional method for measuring drainage density was to measure $\\Lambda$ on a paper map by tracing out each stream. An alternative method, which lends itself to automated calculation from digital elevation models (DEMs), is to derive drainage density from a digital map that depicts the flow-path distance from each grid node to the nearest channel node, $L$ ([Tucker et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0169-555X(00)00056-8)). If the average flow-path distance to channels is $\\overline{L}$, then the corresponding average drainage density is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D_d = \\frac{1}{2\\overline{L}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage of this alternative approach is that $L$ can be mapped and analyzed statistically to reveal spatial variations, correlations with other geospatial attributes, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DrainageDensity` component is designed to calculate $L$, and then derive $D_d$ from it using the second equation above. Given a grid with drainage directions and drainage area, along with either a grid of channel locations or a threshold from which to generate channel locations, `DrainageDensity` component calculates the flow-path distance to the nearest channel node for each node in the grid. The values of $L$ are stored in a new at-node field called `surface_to_channel__minimum_distance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The component assumes that drainage directions and drainage area have already been calculated and the results stored in the following node fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `flow__receiver_node`: ID of the neighboring node to which each node sends flow (its \"receiver\")\n",
    "- `flow__link_to_receiver_node`: ID of the link along which each node sends flow to its receiver\n",
    "- `flow__upstream_node_order`: downstream-to-upstream ordered array of node IDs\n",
    "- `topographic__steepest_slope`: gradient from each node to its receiver\n",
    "\n",
    "The `FlowAccumulator` generates all four of these fields, and should normally be run before `DrainageDensity`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identifying channels\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DrainageDensity` component is NOT very sophisticated about identifying channels. There are (currently) two options for handling channel identification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. specify the parameters of an area-slope channelization threshold, or\n",
    "2. map the channels separately, and pass the result to `DrainageDensity` as a \"channel mask\" array\n",
    "\n",
    "### Area-slope channel threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "This option identifies a channel as occurring at any grid node where the actual drainage area, represented by the field `drainage_area`, exceeds a threshold, $T_c$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_A A^{m_r} C_s S^{n_r} > T_c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $A$ is `drainage_area`, $S$ is `topographic__steepest_slope`, and $C_A$, $C_s$, $m_r$, and $n_r$ are parameters. For example, to create a channel mask in which nodes with a drainage area greater than $10^5$ m$^2$ are identified as channels, the `DrainageDensity` component would be initialized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "dd = DrainageDensity(grid,\n",
    "                     area_coefficient=1.0,\n",
    "                     slope_coefficient=1.0,\n",
    "                     area_exponent=1.0,\n",
    "                     slope_exponent=0.0,\n",
    "                     channelization_threshold=1.0e5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Channel mask\n",
    "\n",
    "This option involves creating a number-of-nodes-long array, of type `np.uint8`, containing a 1 for channel nodes and a 0 for others.\n"

    "\n",
    "The DEM file is in ESRI Ascii format, but is in a geographic projection, with horizontal units of decimal degrees. To calculate slope gradients properly, we'll first read the DEM into a Landlab grid object that has this geographic projection. Then we'll create a second grid with 30 m cell spacing (approximately equal to the NASADEM's resolution), and copy the elevation field from the geographic DEM. This isn't a proper projection of course, but it will do for purposes of this example."

The latter two arguments below tell the lake mapper to update the flow directions and drainage areas after filling the pits."
