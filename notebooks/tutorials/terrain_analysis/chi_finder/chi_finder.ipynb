    "# Using the ChiFinder Component\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ChiFinder` component creates a map of the $\\chi$ drainage network index from a digital elevation model. The $\\chi$ index, described by Perron and Royden (2013), is a function of drainage area, $A$, and elevation, $\\eta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\chi = \\int\\limits_{x_b}^{x} \\left(\\frac{A_0}{A(x)}\\right)^\\theta dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_b$ is the location of the outlet of a watershed of interest, $x$ is a position on a channel somewhere upstream, $A_0$ is a drainage area scale, and $\\theta$ is the concavity index parameter, often taken to be $\\approx$0.5.\n",

    "In this example, we read in a small digital elevation model (DEM) from NASADEM for an area on the Colorado high plains (USA) that includes a portion of an escarpment along the west side of a drainage known as West Bijou Creek (see Rengers & Tucker, 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "The DEM file is in ESRI Ascii format, but is in a geographic projection, with horizontal units of decimal degrees. To calculate slope gradients properly, we'll first read the DEM into a Landlab grid object that has this geographic projec. Then we'll create a second grid with 30 m cell spacing (approximately equal to the NASADEM's resolution), and copy the elevation field from the geographic DEM. This isn't a proper projection of course, but it will do for purposes of this example."
