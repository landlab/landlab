    "# Introduction to the Lithology and LithoLayers objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Lithology and LithoLayers are two Landlab components meant to make it easier to work with spatially variable lithology that produces spatially variable parameter values (e.g. stream power erodability or diffusivity). \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is meant for users who have some experience using Landlab components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will explore the creation of spatially variable lithology and its impact on the evolution of topography. After an introductory example that will let you see how LithoLayers works, we will work through two more complicated examples. In the first example, we use the LithoLayers to erode either dipping layeres or an anticline. Then we will use Lithology to create inverted topography. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use [xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) to store and annotate our model output. While we won't extensively discuss the use of xarray, some background will be provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we will import the necessary modules. A note: this tutorial uses the [HoloViews package](http://holoviews.org) for visualization. This package is a great tool for dealing with multidimentional annotated data (e.g. an xarray dataset). If you get an error on import, consider updating dask (this is what the author needed to do in April 2018). You will also need to have the [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) packages installed.\n",

    "## Part 1: Creating layered rock\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will create an instance of a LithoLayers to learn how this component works. Both LithoLayers and Lithology work closely with a Landlab ModelGrid, storing information about rock type at each grid node. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create LithoLayers you need the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A model grid that has the field `'topographic__elevation'` already created. \n",
    "2. A list of elevations, called `'layer_elevations'` that the bottom of your layers will go through at specified plan-view anchor point (default value for the anchor point is (x, y) = (0, 0)), and a list of rock type IDs that indicate the rock type of that layer. When `'layer_elevations'` is negative that means that the layer goes through the anchor point above the topographic surface. These layers will be created where they extend below the topographic surface.\n",
    "3. A dictionary of rock property attributes that maps a rock ID type to property values.\n",
    "4. A functional form in x and y that defines the shape of your surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of this function form makes it possible for any function of x and y to be passed to LithoLayers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the Lithology and LithoLayers components then know the rock type ID of all the material in the 'block of rock' you have specified. This can be used to continuously know the value of specified rock properties at the topographic surface, even as the rock is eroded, uplifted, or new rock is deposited. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will first make an example to help build intuition and then do two more complex examples. Most of the functionality of Lithology and LithoLayers is shown in this tutorial, but if you want to read the full component documentation for LithoLayers, it can be found [here](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/release/landlab.components.lithology.html).
