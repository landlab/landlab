    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "A Landlab component is implemented as a Python `class`. Although every Landlab component is unique in some respects, to be a component, a class must have at least the following standard ingredients:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) The class must inherit the base class `Component`.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) The class must include a set of standard variables defined in the header (i.e., before the `__init__` method), which describe the data arrays that the component uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) The class must have an `__init__` method defined, with a semi-standardized parameter list described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) The class must provide a function that does performs the component's \"action\", typically named `run_one_step()` and this function's parameter list must follow the convention described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class definition and header\n",
    "\n",
    "A Landlab component is a class that inherits from `Component`. The name of the class should be in CamelCase, and should make sense when used in the sentence: \"A *(component-name)* is a...\". The class definition should be followed by a docstring. The docstring should include a list of parameters for the `__init__` method and succintly describe them."
