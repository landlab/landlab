    "Modeling can be used to test the impact of a process on an object and its properties through time and space. For instance, we can model the impact of mass wasting (the process) on the earth surface (the object) and its topographic elevation (the property). To do this, we need to represent the ***surface*** and its elevation. We could represent this property by a continuous 2-D function, such as a sinusoidal or a polynomial envelope. This is not always simple and practicable (see [Gerya, 2010, p. 37](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781316534243)). Some processes are simulated by partial differential equations. These equations can't always be solved analytically. That roughly means that they can't be easily solved the way x^2 = y + 3 * 3 can be solved (x being the property value before the impact of the process, y the value after the impact of the process). We usually solve these equations numerically. This requires ***discretizing*** the values of the surface properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "To discretize property values, we represent the surface in a ***grid*** of small ***cells*** (also called a mesh) and affect to each cell a value for the property. The value is considered as an average over the cell. This representation is called ***tessellation***. It is also called tiling if the cells are regular. A tessellated space only contain cells that don't overlap with each other, and that don't have a gap between each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also represent the surface in a spatial grid of ***nodes*** and affect a property value to each of them. In this case, the surface is also tessellated in cells. A node is then the single point located at the center of each cell. Two nodes can have a ***link***. Using nodes and links is convenient to represent the fluxes or moves between cells, or to ease computation, for instance of gradients."

    "Board games (review in [Depaulis, 2020](https://doi.org/10.2478/bgs-2020-0007)) are probably the oldest activity consisting in representing surfaces and properties. These games consist in moving pieces from a position to another on a surface, either to win a race or to win a war. The set of positions is limited, and the moves follow a set of rules: pieces can't go where they want and the way they want. Then the simplest way to represent the surface and its rule is using a network grid. Positions are represented by points, also called nodes, and the possible paths are represented by links. The ancient board of the alquerque game, the ancestor of checkers, is an illustration of this class of grids. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Landlab, this class is implemented by the ***NetworkModelGrid***. A regular grid instance of this class is shown **Fig. 2**. Note that the implementation of the NetworkGrid allows irregular networks, where links are of variable lengths and directions. The NetworkModelGrid class is adapted for surfaces subject to fluxes of particles or agents which are constrained by the river or the road network (See [the network_sediment_transporter notebook](../network_sediment_transporter/network_sediment_transporter.ipynb)). <br>"

    "Board games can be more complex than checkers. For instance, chess splits pieces in a diverse family. Their members don't follow the same rules to move, and these rules depend on the color property value of their initial position. The network grid has an inconvenient for this use, because visibility of the property values can be hindered by the pieces. Players rather use a grid of squares. Square and rectangular grids are implemented by the ***RasterModelGrid*** (**Fig. 3**). Note that NetworkModelGrid and RasterModelGrid can be combined (see the [run_network_generator_OpenTopoDEM notebook](../network_sediment_transporter/run_network_generator_OpenTopoDEM.ipynb)).\n",

Square grids are practical because many mathematical operations on them are simple. Still, links of square grids can complexify the computation of fluxes between cells, because these links can be orthogonal to faces and ***diagonal***. Presently, with efficient algorithms and massive computer power, other classes of grids can have easy access to practical coordinate systems, resampling, combination of several grids. \n",

    "The most promissing type of regular grid is hexagonal like an Agon board game. It is implemented by the ***HexModelGrid*** (**Fig. 3**). This type of grid presents some advantages for modeling ([Birch et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2007.03.041) and [H3 by Uber](https://h3geo.org/). All links are orthogonal, which is favorable to study connections, least expensive paths, and fluxes. Hexagons have properties close to circles (tesselation can't use circles because of the gaps or overlapping between cells). They are adapted to modeling on large areas of a planet, because they better fit curved surfaces. They also have a small perimeter/area ratio, which reduces the edge effects of the grid. And natural patterns are usually more curvilinear than rectilinear. Hexagons help to visually spot these patterns without rectilinear modeling artefacts.\n",

    "The HexModelGrid is an interesting compromise between RasterModelGrid and irregular grids. The hex grid is used in the [landlab-fault-scarp](../fault_scarp/landlab-fault-scarp.ipynb) and the [listric_kinematic_extender notebooks](../tectonics/listric_kinematic_extender.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comment**: Another type of regular grid is the triangular grid, which is not implemented in Landlab. The applications of triangular grids in geomodeling might be limited. Contrary to square and hex grids, cells are oriented in two directions. Similar to the square grids, links can also be diagonal. "

But they are still not commonly adopted. These grids are constructed from nodes that are not regularly organized on the surface. Their position can be random or link to a point of interest, for instance weather stations. Then, we construct Voronoi cells for the set of nodes. The Voronoi construction aims to make each node the closest node for all the points within its cell. Then, the links between the nodes are constructed following a Delaunay triangulation. This triangulation optimizes the construction so that no link cross another link and makes a network of triangles which edges are the links.\n",

The drainage network forms without favoring specific directions, even when close to the grid boundaries, and has roughly similar patterns and properties whatever the resolution.

The boundary nodes are automatically fixed, in a not random way. The core nodes are first positioned in a regular, rectangular pattern, and then moved by a random distance in such a way that a minimal distance between nodes is respected. This minimal distance is convenient when we have to run diffusion or river incision processes on the grid, which can become unstable for two small distances between nodes (depending on the timestep of the run)."

    "## <a name=\"IcosphereGlobalGrid\">8. IcosphereGlobalGrid</a>\n",
    "The earth is a planet, and planets are round. For global models of surface or near-surface processes, it is helpful to have grid types that represent the surface of a spherical or near-spherical body such as our own planet. IcosphereGlobalGrid (**Fig. 8**) is a grid type that represents a planetary surface as an *icosphere*, also known as a *geodesic polyhedron*. An icosphere is a convex polyhedron composed of triangular faces, and it has the characteristic of having a dual geometry consisting of Goldberg Polyhedra (mostly hexagons, rather like a soccer ball). A useful property of an icosphere is the ability to subdivide it to any arbirary level of resolution by subdividing each triangle into four smaller triangles. Landlab's IcosphereGlobalGrid includes both elements of the dual geometry: an icosphere composed of triangular *patches* with *nodes* as vertices and *links* as edges, and a Goldberg Polyhedron composed of pentagonal and hexagonal *cells* with *corners* as vertices and *faces* as the edges of the pentagons and hexagons. The icosphere allows a relatively even distribution of points across the surface, as compared with a latitude-longitude grid, in which points bunch together around the poles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the various 2D grid types, the nodes and corners in an IcosphereGlobalGrid has a $z$ coordinate in addition to their $x$ and $y$ coordinates. The grid also provides the corresponding spherical coordinates $r$, $\\phi$, and $\\theta$ ($r$ being radial distance from the center of the sphere, $\\phi$ the longitude, and $\\theta$ the latitude angle measured from zero at the \"south\" pole (so the equator lies at $\\theta = \\pi/2$ and the north pole lies at $\\theta = \\pi$).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an IcosphereGlobalGrid, the user specifies a radius (default is 1) and a level of mesh densification. The mesh densification level represents the number of times the mesh is subdivided.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to visualize an IcosphereGlobalGrid is to use the `landlab.io.legacy_vtk.dump` function to output to a Legacy VTK file, and read that file into ParaView or an alternative 3D visualization package."
