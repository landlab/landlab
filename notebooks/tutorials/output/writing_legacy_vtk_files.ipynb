    "# Writing with legacy vtk files\n",
    "\n",
    "*(GE Tucker, CU Boulder, first version June 2023)*\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Visualization Toolkit (VTK)](https://docs.vtk.org/en/latest/index.html) is an open-source software system for visualization. It offers two file formats: one based on XML, and the other---the so-called **legacy VTK** format---using a simple text-based format. These file formats are readable by visualization packages such as [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/), so it is useful to be able to output VTK format for Landlab grids and fields. This tutorial demonstrates Landlab's legacy VTK file-output capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The format\n",
    "\n",
    "To quote from the VTK [documentation](https://docs.vtk.org/en/latest/design_documents/VTKFileFormats.html): \n",
    "\n",
    "\"*The legacy VTK file formats consist of five basic parts.*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *The first part is the file version and identifier. This part contains the single line: vtk DataFile Version x.x. This line must be exactly as shown with the exception of the version number x.x, which will vary with different releases of VTK. (Note: the current version number is 3.0. Version 1.0 and 2.0 files are compatible with version 3.0 files.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *The second part is the header. The header consists of a character string terminated by end-of-line character \\n. The header is 256 characters maximum. The header can be used to describe the data and include any other pertinent information.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *The next part is the file format. The file format describes the type of file, either ASCII or binary. On this line the single word ASCII or BINARY must appear.*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *The fourth part is the dataset structure. The geometry part describes the geometry and topology of the dataset. This part begins with a line containing the keyword DATASET followed by a keyword describing the type of dataset.Then, depending upon the type of dataset, other keyword/data combinations define the actual data.*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *The final part describes the dataset attributes. This part begins with the keywords POINT_DATA or CELL_DATA, followed by an integer number specifying the number of points or cells, respectively. (It doesnâ€™t matter whether POINT_DATA or CELL_DATA comes first.) Other keyword/data combinations then define the actual dataset attribute values (i.e., scalars, vectors, tensors, normals, texture coordinates, or field data).*\"\n"
