    "This Jupyter notebook illustrates running the transport-length-model hillslope diffusion component in a simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "This component uses an approach similar to the Davy and Lague (2009) equation for fluvial erosion and transport, and applies it to hillslope diffusion. The formulation and implementation were inspired by Carretier et al. (2016); see this paper and references therein for justification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The elevation $z$ of a point of the landscape (such as a grid node) changes according to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} = -\\epsilon + D + U  \\tag{1}\\label{eq:1},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "and we define:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " D = \\frac{q_s}{L}  \\tag{2}\\label{eq:2},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ is the local erosion rate [*L/T*], $D$ the local deposition rate [*L/T*], $U$ the uplift (or subsidence) rate [*L/T*], $q_s$ the incoming sediment flux per unit width [*L$^2$/T*] and $L$ is the **transport length**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We specify the erosion rate $\\epsilon$ and the transport length $L$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " \\epsilon = \\kappa S  \\tag{3}\\label{eq:3}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " L = \\frac{dx}{1-({S}/{S_c})^2}  \\tag{4}\\label{eq:4}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\kappa$ [*L/T*] is an erodibility coefficient, $S$ is the local slope [*L/L*] and $S_c$ is the critical slope [*L/L*]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the elevation variation results from the difference between local rates of detachment and deposition. \n",
    "\n",
    "The detachment rate is proportional to the local gradient. However, the deposition rate ($q_s/L$) depends on the local slope and the critical slope:\n",
    "- when $S \\ll S_c$, most of the sediment entering a node is deposited there, this is the pure diffusion case. In this case, the sediment flux $q_s$ does not include sediment eroded from above and is thus \"local\".\n",
    "- when $S \\approx S_c$, $L$ becomes infinity and there is no redeposition on the node, the sediments are transferred further downstream.  This behaviour corresponds to mass wasting, grains can travel a long distance before being deposited. In that case, the flux $q_s$ is \"non-local\" as it incorporates sediments that have both been detached  locally and transited from upslope.\n",
    "- for an intermediate $S$, there is a prgogressive transition between pure creep and \"balistic\" transport of the material. This is consistent with experiments (Roering et al., 2001; Gabet and Mendoza, 2012).\n",

    "## Contrast with the non-linear diffusion model\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous models typically use a \"non-linear\" diffusion model proposed by different authors (e.g. Andrews and Hanks, 1985; Hanks, 1999; Roering et al., 1999) and supported by $^{10}$Be-derived erosion rates (e.g. Binnie et al., 2007) or experiments (Roering et al., 2001). It is usually presented in the followin form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ $\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$ $\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " q_s = \\frac{\\kappa' S}{1-({S}/{S_c})^2}   \\tag{6}\\label{eq:6}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\kappa'$ [*L$^2$/T*] is a diffusion coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "This description is thus based on the definition of a flux of transported sediment parallel to the slope:\n",
    "- when the slope is small, this flux refers to diffusion-like processes such as biogenic soil disturbance, rain splash, or diffuse runoff\n",
    "- when the slope gets closer to the specified critical slope, the flux increases dramatically, simulating on average the cumulative effect of mass wasting events.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these conceptual differences, equations ($\\ref{eq:3}$) and ($\\ref{eq:4}$) predict similar topographic evolution to the 'non-linear' diffusion equations for $\\kappa' = \\kappa dx$, as shown in the following example."
