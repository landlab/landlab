    "# How to do \"D4\" pit-filling on a digital elevation model (DEM)\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Greg Tucker, July 2021)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital elevation models (DEMs) often contain \"pits\": cells or groups of cells that represent depressions, and are surrounded by higher-elevation cells. Sometimes these pits represent real landscape features, such as sinkholes in a karst landscape, or \"pools\" along a dry river channel. In other cases, they are artifacts of errors in the original data or of data processing. Sometimes they reflect a truncated representation of elevation values. For example, some DEMs use integer values to represent elevation in meters. Adjacent cells that differ by less than a meter in elevation can register as having exactly the same elevation in an integer DEM, making the drainage pathways in ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some overland flow models, depressions in a DEM are no problem: water will simply pool in the depressions and overspill when the depression is full. But overland flow models that use the kinematic wave approximation, in which the ground-surface slope is used as a proxy for the hydraulic energy slope, can not do this. Therefore, 2D overland flow models, like the Landlab components `KinwaveOverlandFlowModel` and `KinwaveImplicitOverlandFlow`, require a DEM that has had its pits and flat areas digitally removed before they can be run reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial describes how to do this using Landlab's flow-routing and pit-filling components.\n"

    "Having read the DEM and set its boundary conditions, we now instantiate and run `FlowAccumulator`. We will tell it to use \"D4\" routing, which is indicated by the parameter choice `flow_director = FlowDirectorSteepest`. (Note that the term \"steepest\" means \"choose the steepest drop among all directly adjacent nodes\". In a RasterModelGrid, there are normally four neighboring nodes, and so when `FlowDirectorSteepest` is applied to a raster grid, it does 'D4' routing. When it is applied to a hex grid, for example, it chooses among six possible directions. This variation in the number of potential directions depending on grid type is why it this particular flow-direction method is called \"steepest\" rather than \"D4\". For more on this, see the tutorials *the_FlowDirectors* and *compare_FlowDirectors*.)\n",
