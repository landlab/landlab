    "\n",
    "There are two related components that calculate erosion resulting from surface-water flow, a.k.a. overland flow: `DepthSlopeProductErosion` and `DetachmentLtdErosion`. They were originally created by Jordan Adams to work with the `OverlandFlow` component, which solves for water depth across the terrain. They are similar to the `StreamPowerEroder` and `FastscapeEroder` components in that they calculate erosion resulting from water flow across a topographic surface, but whereas these components require a flow-routing algorithm to create a list of node \"receivers\", the `DepthSlopeProductErosion` and `DetachmentLtdErosion` components only require a user-identified slope field together with an at-node depth or discharge field (respectively)."

    "where $k_e$ is an erodibility coefficient (with dimensions of velocity per stress$^a$), $\\tau$ is bed shear stress, $\\tau_c$ is a minimum bed shear stress for any erosion to occur, and $a$ is a parameter that is commonly treated as unity.\n",

    "The component uses a user-supplied slope field (at nodes) together with the water-depth field `surface_water__depth` to calculate $\\tau$, and then the above equation to calculate $E$.

If the user wishes to apply material uplift relative to baselevel, an `uplift_rate` parameter can be passed on initialization.\n",

    "Note that in order to accomplish this, we need to identify which variable we wish to use for slope gradient. This is not quite as simple as it may sound. An easy way to define slope is as the slope between two adjacent grid nodes. But using this approach means that slope is defined on the grid *links* rathter than *nodes*. To calculate slope magnitude at *nodes*, we'll define a little function below that uses Landlab's `calc_grad_at_link` method to calculate gradients at grid links, then use the `map_link_vector_components_to_node` method to calculate the $x$ and $y$ vector components at each node. With that in hand, we just use the Pythagorean theorem to find the slope magnitude from its vector components.\n",
