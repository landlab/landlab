    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The Green-Ampt method was introduced by Green and Ampt (1911) as a means of approximating the rate of water infiltration into soil from a layer of surface water. The method represents infiltration in terms of a wetting front that descends into the soil as infiltration progresses. A description of the method can be found in many hydrology textbooks, and in various online resources. The following is a brief summary, using the notation of Julien et al. (1995). The dimensions of each variable are indicated in square brackets, using the common convention that [L] means length, [M] is mass, and [T] is time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Green-Ampt method approximates the rate of water infiltration into the soil, $f$ (dimensions of [L/T], representing water volume per unit surface area). Infiltration is driven by two effects:  gravitational force, and downward suction (the \"paper towel effect\") due to a gradient in moisture at the wetting front. The method treats the infiltration rate as a function of the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $K$ - saturated hydraulic conductivity [L/T]\n",
    "- $H_f$ - capillary pressure head at the wetting front [L]\n",
    "- $\\phi$ - total soil porosity [-]\n",
    "- $\\theta_r$ - residual saturation [-]\n",
    "- $\\theta_e$ - effective porosity $= \\phi - \\theta_r$ [-]\n",
    "- $\\theta_i$ - initial soil moisture content [-]\n",
    "- $M_d$ - moisture deficit $=\\theta_e - \\theta_i$ [-]\n",
    "- $F$ - total infiltrated water depth [L]\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation for infiltration rate is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f = K \\left( 1 + \\frac{H_fM_d}{F} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first term in parentheses represents gravity and the second represents pore suction. If there were no pore suction effect, water would simply infiltrate downward at a rate equal to the  hydraulic conductivity, $K$. The suction effect increases this, but it becomes weaker as the cumulative infiltration depth $F$ grows. Effectively, the second term approximates the pore-pressure gradient, which declines as the wetting front descends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The version used in this component adds a term for the weight of the surface water with depth $H$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f = K \\left( 1 + \\frac{H_fM_d}{F} + \\frac{H}{F} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The component uses a simple forward-difference numerical scheme, with time step duration $\\Delta t$, in which the infiltration depth during one step is the lesser of the rate calculated above times $\\Delta t$, or the available surface water, $H$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta F = \\min( f\\Delta t, H)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the cumulative infitration $F$ must be greater than zero in order to avoid division by zero; therefore, one should initialize the `soil_water_infiltration__depth` to a small positive value."

Therefore, after reading topography data into a grid called `demgrid`, which uses UTM coordinates, we copy over the elevation data into a second grid (`grid`) of the same dimensions that uses local coordinates (i.e., the lower left corner is (0, 0))."
