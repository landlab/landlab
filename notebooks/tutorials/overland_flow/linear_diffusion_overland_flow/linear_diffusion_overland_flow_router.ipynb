    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the `LinearDiffusionOverlandFlowRouter` Landlab component. The component implements a two-dimensional model of overland flow, based on a linearization of the diffusion-wave approximation of the shallow-water equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flow direction, depth, and velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "The diffusion-wave equations are a simplified form of the 2D shallow-water equations in which energy slope is assumed to equal water-surface slope. Conservation of water mass is expressed in terms of the time derivative of the local water depth, $H$, and the spatial derivative (divergence) of the unit discharge vector $\\mathbf{q} = UH$ (where $U$ is the 2D depth-averaged velocity vector):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} = R - \\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{q}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R$ is the local runoff rate [L/T] and $\\mathbf{q}$ has dimensions of volume flow per time per width [L$^2$/T]. The flow velocity is calculated using a linearized form of the Manning friction law:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{U} = \\frac{H^{4/3}}{n^2 u_c} \\nabla w$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w = \\eta + H$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\eta(x,y,t)$ is ground-surface elevation, $w(x,y,t)$ is water-surface elevation, $n$ is the Manning friction coefficient, and $u_c$ is a characteristic scale velocity (see, e.g., Mariotti, 2018). Thus, there are two parameters governing flow speed: $n$ and $u_c$. The may, however, be treated as a single lumped parameter $n^2 u_c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rainfall and infiltration\n",
    "\n",
    "Runoff rate is calculated as the difference between the rates of precipitation, $P$, and infiltration, $I$. The user specifies a precipitation rate (which is a public variable that can be modified after instantiation), and a maximum infiltration rate, $I_c$. The actual infiltration rate depends on the available surface water, and is calculated in a way that allows it to approach zero as the surface-water depth approaches zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I = I_c \\left( 1 - e^{-H/H_i} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $H_i$ is a characteristic water depth, defined such that the actual infiltration rate is about 95% of $I_c$ when $H = 3 H_i$."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Numerical Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finite-volume representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The component uses an explicit, forward-Euler finite-volume method. The solution for water depth at a new time step $k+1$ is calculated from:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_i^{k+1} = H_i^k + \\Delta t \\left[ \\frac{dH_i}{dt} \\right]_i^k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The time derivative at step $k$ is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left[ \\frac{dH_i}{dt} \\right]_i^k = R - I - \\frac{1}{\\Lambda_i} \\sum_{j=1}^{N_i} \\lambda_{ij} q_{ij}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R$ is rainfall rate, $I$ is infiltration rate (calculated as above), $\\Lambda_i$ is the horizontal surface area of the cell enclosing node $i$, $\\lambda_{ij}$ is the length of the cell face between node $i$ and its $j$-th neighbor, and $q_{ij}$ is the specific water discharge along the link that connects node $i$ and its $j$-th neighbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a raster grid, this treatment is equivalent to a centered-in-space finite-difference arrangement. For more on finite-difference solutions to diffusion problems, see for example Slingerland and Kump (2011) and Press et al. (1986).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time-step limiter\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the linearization described above, the flow model is effectively a diffusion problem with a space- and time-varying diffusivity, because the effective diffusivity $D$ depends on water depth:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D = \\frac{H^{7/3}}{n^2 u_c}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One numerical challenge is that, according to the Courant-Levy-Friedrichs (CFL) criterion, the maximum stable time step will depend on water depth, which varies in space and time. To prevent instability, the solution algorithm calculates at every iteration a maximum value for $D$ using the current maximum water depth (or a very small minimum value, whichever is larger, to prevent blowup in the case of zero water depth). The maximum step size is then calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta t_\\text{max} = \\alpha \\frac{L_\\text{min}^2}{2 D}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $L_\\text{min}$ is the length of the shortest link in the grid (which is just equal to node spacing, $\\Delta x$, for a uniform raster or hex grid). The stability factor $\\alpha$ is a user-controllable parameter that defaults to 0.2, and must be $\\le 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\Delta t_\\text{max}$ is less than the user-specified \"global\" time step duration, the algorithm iterates repeatedly with time steps of size $\\Delta t_\\text{max}$ (or the remaining time in the global step, whichever is smaller) until the global time step duration has been completed.\n"
