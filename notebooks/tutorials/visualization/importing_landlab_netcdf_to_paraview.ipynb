    "[ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) is a powerful open-source visualization engine developed by kitware. It provides fast 3D rendering of surfaces and volumes, and is a great way to inspect output from a Landlab-built model. There are currently two ways to write Landlab grid and field data in a format that ParaView can read. The first, for raster grids, is to use the NetCDF file format. The second, and still under development as of this writing, is to use the Legacy VTK file format, which works for hex grid and in principle other grid types as well. This tutorial covers the first method: writing Landlab output to NetCDF file(s) for input into ParaView. It explains, with a worked example, how to create NetCDF output, how to read this into ParaView, how to convert the flat images into 3D surfaces, how to color them according to different fields, and how to create animations.\n",

    "## Creating a Landlab model as an example\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, we'll create a simple landscape evolution model in which the landscape consists of a layer of soil on top of a layer of rock. Weathering of rock to soil will be calculated using an inverse exponential function, as implemented by the `ExponentialWeatherer` component. Soil creep will be represented with a nonlinear diffusion model, using the `DepthDependentTaylorDiffuser` component (Barnhart et al., 2019). Runoff routing will be modeled with a steepest descent \"D8\" algorithm using the `FlowAccumulator` component (Barnhart et al., 2020). Fluvial erosion, transport, and deposition will be modeled using the `SPACE` component (Shobe et al., 2017). To learn more about the theory, math, and numerics behind these, see the references listed.\n",
