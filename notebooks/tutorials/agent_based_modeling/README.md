# Agent-based modeling with Landlab and Mesa

The tutorials in this collection illustrate how to combine Landlab components
and capabilities with the agent-based modeling (ABM) package Mesa to create
integrated simulations that combine ABMs and grid-based continuum-type models.
The examples are deliberately simple, and are designed to show how integrated
models can be built rather than to demonstrate any particular application.
