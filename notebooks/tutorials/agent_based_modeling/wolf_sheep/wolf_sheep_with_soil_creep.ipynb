    "# Wolf-Sheep-Grass Model with Soil Creep\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates coupling of an ABM implemented in Mesa and a grid-based numerical model written in Landlab. The example is the canonical \"wolf-sheep-grass\" example of an agent-based model. Here we add an additional twist: when sheep eat grass, the soil beneath becomes more easily mobile. This then influences soil transport: the transport efficiency is higher where the grass is \"damaged\". An additional feedback lies in the thickness of the soil: grass will not grow if the soil is too thin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules in this example are deliberately simple. The main goal of this tutorial is to illustrate the mechanics of building an integrated model that combines agent-based elements (via Mesa) with continuum-based elements (via Landlab) on a shared grid.\n",
