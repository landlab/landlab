    "# Introduction to the NormalFault component\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides an introduction to the `NormalFault` component in the Landlab toolkit. This component takes the following parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Parameters\n",
    "    --------\n",
    "    grid : ModelGrid\n",
    "    faulted_surface : str or ndarray of shape `(n_nodes, )` or list of str\n",
    "        or ndarrays. \n",
    "        Surface that is modified by the NormalFault component. Can be a\n",
    "        field name or array or a list of strings or ndarrays if the fault.\n",
    "        should uplift more than one field. Default value is \n",
    "        `topographic__elevation`.\n",
    "    fault_throw_rate_through_time : dict, optional\n",
    "        Dictionary that specifies the time varying throw rate on the fault.\n",
    "        Expected format is:\n",
    "        ``fault_throw_rate_through_time = {'time': array, 'rate': array}``\n",
    "        Default value is a constant rate of 0.001 (units not specified).\n",
    "    fault_dip_angle : float, optional\n",
    "        Dip angle of the fault in degrees.  Default value is 90 degrees.\n",
    "    fault_trace : dictionary, optional\n",
    "        Dictionary that specifies the coordinates of two locations on the\n",

    "        ``fault_trace = {'x1': float, 'y1': float, 'x2': float, 'y2': float}``\n",
    "        where the vector from ``(x1, y1)`` to ``(x2, y2)`` defines the\n",

    "        to the strike follows the right hand rule.\n",
    "        Default is for the fault to strike NE.\n",

    "where $t$ is the fault throw rate and $d$ is the fault dip angle. \n",

The strike of the fault, specified with the right-hand rule convention, is the vector from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2). Give that this component creates a normal fault, in which the footwall moves up relative to the hanging wall, this means that the nodes that are counterclockwise from the strike are the uplifted nodes. \n",
