    "## Introduction and background\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces the `DepthDependentTaylorDiffuser` component, which we'll refer to here as \"DDTD\". The DDTD component models the process of downslope soil creep and its role in modifying topography. It combines the mathematics behind two other components: `DepthDependentDiffuser` and `TaylorNonLinearDiffuser`. The component is described (as one element in the terrainBento package) in Barnhart et al. (2019), which is the appropriate paper to cite for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a topographic surface in which the elevation at any time $t$ and horizontal position $(x,y)$ is $\\eta (x,y,t)$. The thickness of the mobile soil layer is $H(x,y,t)$. Let $\\mathbf{q}_s$ be a 2D vector that represents the rate of soil volume flow per unit slope width (with dimensions of length squared per time; we'll assume that $\\mathbf{q}_s$ represents a \"bulk\" flux that includes pore spaces between soil grains). In the absence of any \"local\" input sources (such as weathering of rock) or output (such as removal by wash erosion), conservation of mass dictates that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}_s$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The DDTD component represents the soil flux as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{q}_s = K H_* \\mathbf{S} [1 - \\exp ( - H / H_*)] [ 1 + (S/S_c)^2 + (S/S_c)^4 + ... + (S/S_c)^2(n-1) ]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{S} = -\\nabla \\eta$ is the downslope topographic gradient, and $S$ is its magnitude. Parameter $H_*$ is a depth scale that determines how rapidly transport rate decays as the soil thins. Parameter $K$ is a transport coefficient with dimensions of velocity. The effective diffusion-like coefficient is $D=KH_*$. This is the effective diffusivity when the soil is much thicker than $H_*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above can be written slightly more compactly:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{q}_s = K H_* \\mathbf{S} [1 - \\exp ( - H / H_*)] \\left[ 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left(\\frac{S}{S_c}\\right)^{2i} \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $i$ is the number of additional terms desired. If $i=0$, the expression is the same as the depth-dependent, slope-linear transport function implemented by the `DepthDependentDiffuser` component and described, for example, by Johnstone and Hilley (2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of a truncated Taylor series is meant to approximate the Andrews-Bucknam transport function (e.g., Roering et al., 1999) while avoiding that equation's blow-up at $S=S_c$; the idea of using a truncated Taylor series comes from Ganti et al. (2012).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The component uses an explicit finite-volume solution method. Soil flux values are calculated from the gradient values on the active links, using the grid method `calc_grad_at_link`. Flux divergence is then calculated using the grid method `calc_flux_div_at_node`. The calculation updates soil thickness, bedrock elevation (using the user-provided values of the `soil_production__rate` field), and total elevation as the sum of the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "An optional dynamic timestep capability will check the local Courant condition (which can vary in time and space when nonlinear terms are included) and sub-divide the user-specified time step as needed to ensure stability."

    "### Example 1: equilibrium hillslope profile with linear diffusion\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first example, we'll use a long and skinny grid to effectively create a 1D domain. We'll test the ability of DDTD to reduce to a simple linear, depth-independent diffusive model when $i=0$ and $H \\gg H_*$. We'll impose (relative) rock uplift by raising the interior of the domain at a specified rate $U$ relative to the fixed boundary nodes on either side. The expectation is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d\\eta}{dx} = -\\frac{U}{D}x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is distance from the ridge top (because the ridge top will form in the middle of the domain, $x<0$ on the left and $x>0$ on the right). Integrating this, we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\eta = -\\frac{U}{2D} x^2 + C$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can evaluate the integration constant by noting that $\\eta = 0$ at $x = \\pm L$, where $L$ is the distance from base to crest. Therefore,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boxed{\\eta = \\frac{U}{2D} \\left( L^2 - x^2 \\right)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll test this using a hill that is 100 m long (51 nodes, two of which are fixed boundaries, with 2 m spacing between them; 50 m from base to crest on each side), a soil layer that is much thicker than the characteristic decay depth $H^*$, a transport coefficient of 0.01 m$^2$/y, and an uplift rate of 0.0001 m/y. With these parameters, the predicted ridge height (at $x=0$) is calculated below.\n"
