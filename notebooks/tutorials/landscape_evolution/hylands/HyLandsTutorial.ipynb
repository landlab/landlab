    "The Landlab BedrockLandslider (Hybrid Landscape evolution model) component computes stochastic deep-seated bedrock landsliding and landslide-derived sediment runout across two-dimensional model landscapes. \n",

Ideally, a fluvial incision code tracking both bedrock incision and sediment transport is used. Throughout this notebook, we will use the Landlab SPACE component for that purpose. The user is motivated to check out the SPACE notebook before applying the BedrockLandslider component ([see notebook on SPACE](../space/SPACE_user_guide_and_examples.ipynb) and [notebook on SPACELargeScaleEroder](../space/SPACE_large_scale_eroder_user_guide_and_examples.ipynb)).\n",

Basic familiarity with the Landlab modeling toolkit (see Hobley et al., 2017 GMD, and Barnhart et al., 2020 eSurf) is recommended."

    "### Step 2: Define the model domain and initial conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "The BedrockLandslider and SPACE components work on raster grids. For this example we will use a synthetic raster grid. In addition to using user-defined, synthetic model grids, it is also possible to import digital elevation models for use as a model domain (see the tutorial *reading_dem_into_landlab*). In this example, we create a synthetic, square model domain by creating an instance of the RasterModelGrid. In this case, the domain will be a plane with random micro-scale topographic roughness to force flow convergence and channelization, and the development of realistic landscapes. The grid is composed of 50 rows and 50 columns for a total of 250 nodes, with user-defined spacing of 25m.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the grid has been created, the user defines a grid field to contain values of land surface elevation, and then imposes the desired initial condition topography on the model grid. In the case shown below, the field `topographic__elevation` is added to the model grid and given initial values of all zeros. After that, initial model topography is added to the field. Randomized micro-scale topographic roughness is added to the model grid. While not strictly necessary for the SPACE and BedrockLandslider models to run, the micro-roughness allows flow convergence, channelization, and the development of realistic landscapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we initialize the model domain with 2 meters of sediment thickness at every core (non-boundary) node. The sediment thickness will shrink over time as water mobilizes and removes sediment. To do this, the fields `soil__depth` and `bedrock__elevation` must be added to the model grid. If they are not added, the SPACE model will create them. In that case, however, the default sediment thickness is zero and the default bedrock topography is simply the provided topographic elevation."
