    "This tutorial introduces the `ErosionDeposition` component, which simulates erosion and deposition in a river network over long time scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory and Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "`ErosionDeposition` models fluvial processes using the approach described by Davy and Lague (2009). The basic goal is to calculate rates of erosion or deposition in the various branches of a river network that is embedded in a gridded landscape (see, e.g., Tucker and Hancock, 2010). The literature has a number of different approaches to this problem. Some models assume transport-limited conditions, such that erosion or deposition result from local imbalances in sediment transport capacity (see, e.g., Willgoose, 2018). Some assume detachment-limited conditions, such that any eroded sediment is entirely removed  (e.g., Howard, 1994; Whipple and Tucker, 1999; Tucker and Whipple, 2002). Still others allow for both erosion of detachment-resistant material (bedrock or cohesive sediments), and re-deposition of that material. The Davy-Lague approach falls in the latter category, and is similar to the approach used in some shorter-term morphodynamic models as well as agricultural soil erosion models. The basic idea involves conservation of sediment mass in the water column of a river. One calculates the rate of entrainment of sediment from the bed into the water as a function of discharge and local slope. The bed also accumulates sediment that settles out from the water column, at a rate that depends on sediment concentration (treated as the ratio of sediment flux to water discharge) and a settling-velocity parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory behind using this kind of dual erosion-deposition approach in the context of fluvial landscape evolution is described by Davy and Lague (2009). Tucker and Hancock (2010) provide a review of landscape evolution modeling that compares this with other approaches to fluvial erosion/deposition theory. The equations used in the Landlab `ErosionDeposition` component are described by Barnhart et al. (2019) as part of the *terrainBento* collection of Landlab-based landscape evolution models, which includes models that use `ErosionDeposition`."
