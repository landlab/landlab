    "## Background on SPACE component\n",
    "\n",
    "The Landlab SPACE (Stream Power with Alluvium Conservation and Entrainment) component computes sediment transport and bedrock erosion across two-dimensional model landscapes. The SPACE model provides advantages relative to many other fluvial erosion models in that it 1) allows simultaneous erosion of sediment and bedrock, 2) explicitly treats sediment fluxes rather than relying on a proxy for bed cover, and 3) is easily coupled with other surface process components in Landlab. The SPACE component enhances Landlab’s functionality by enabling modeling of bedrock-alluvial channels, rather than simply using parameterized sediment-flux-dependent incision models.\n",

    "examples provided in Shobe et al. (2017).\n",

    "Prerequisites: A working knowledge of the Python programming language\n",

    "and MatPlotLib libraries. Basic familiarity with the Landlab modeling toolkit (see Hobley et al., 2017 GMD, and Barnhart et al., 2020 eSurf) is recommended."

    "### Step 2: Define the model domain and initial conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "The SPACE component works on raster grids. For this example we will use a synthetic raster grid. An example and description of the Landlab raster model grid are given in (Shobe et al., 2017), with a more complete explanation offered in Hobley et al. (2017) and Barnhart et al. (2020). In addition to using user-defined, synthetic model grids, it is also possible to import digital elevation models for use as a model domain (see the tutorial *reading_dem_into_landlab*). In this example, we create a synthetic, square model domain by creating an instance of the RasterModelGrid. In this case, the domain will be a plane slightly tilted towards the lower-left (southwest) corner with random micro-scale topographic roughness to force flow convergence and channelization. The grid is composed of 20 rows and 20 columns for a total of 400 nodes, with user-defined spacing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the grid has been created, the user defines a grid field to contain values of land surface elevation, and then imposes the desired initial condition topography on the model grid. In the case shown below, the field `topographic__elevation` is added to the model grid and given initial values of all zeros. After that, initial model topography is added to the field. To create a plane tilted to the southwest corner, which is referenced by $(x,y)$ coordinate pair (0,0), topographic elevation is modified to depend on the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of each grid node. Then, randomized micro-scale topographic roughness is added to the model grid. While not strictly necessary for the SPACE model to run, the micro-roughness allows flow convergence, channelization, and the development of realistic landscapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we initialize the model domain with 2 meters of sediment thickness at every core (non-boundary) node. The sediment thickness will shrink over time as water mobilizes and removes sediment. To do this, the fields `soil__depth` and `bedrock__elevation` must be added to the model grid. If they are not added, the SPACE model will create them. In that case, however, the default sediment thickness is zero and the default bedrock topography is simply the provided topographic elevation."
