    "# The Landlab GravelRiverTransporter Component\n",
    "\n",
    "*G.E. Tucker, CIRES and Department of Geological Sciences, University of Colorado Boulder*\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes the `GravelRiverTransporter` component and its underlying theory, and provides some simple examples of usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "`GravelRiverTransporter` is a Landlab component for modeling landscape evolution in the context of a network of gravel-bed alluvial channels. The component is meant to operate on a 2d grid in conjunction with a single-direction flow routing scheme, such that each grid node drains to one and only one of its neighbors. Channels are assumed to be sub-grid-scale features with a bankfull channel width that adjusts according to the local discharge, slope, and grain diameter. The approach follows that of Wickert & Schildgen (2019), but with two additions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Because the channel network is calculated from, and embedded within, a topographic field represented as a 2d grid, conservation of mass is calculated on the basis of individual grid cells rather than using a prescribed valley width.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The theory implemented by the component includes the progressive loss of gravel load due to abrasion; the lost material is assumed to become part of the suspended and/or wash load, which is not explicitly tracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory that channels with gravel bed and bank materials tend to adjust their shear stress ratio dates back to Parker (1978), and a variety of studies have supported the idea for gravel rivers. Phillips and Jerolmack (2016) argued that the concept may also be applicable to some \"bedrock\" rivers as well (the question depends somewhat on the definition of \"bedrock river\", but presumably would apply to a river that is capable of eroding into bedrock but that also has at least one self-formed bank made of alluvial material, so that erosion or deposition of bank material alters the hydraulic geometry)."

    "### Channel-width adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "We treat only the coarse, bed-load fraction. We assume channel width adjusts so as to ensure that bankfull shear stress is slightly larger (by a fraction $\\epsilon$) than critical shear stress for the median sediment diameter. Wickert & Schildgen (2019) show that when this is the case, the channel tends to adjust such that its bankfull width depends on bankfull discharge, $Q$, channel gradient, $S$, and the median diameter of sediment on the bed, $D$, as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$b = k_b \\frac{QS^{7/6}}{D^{3/2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k_b$ is a factor given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$k_b = 0.17 g^{-1/2} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\rho_s-\\rho}{\\rho}\\right)(1+\\epsilon )\\tau_c^*\\right]^{-5/3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g$ is gravitational acceleration, $\\rho_s$ is sediment grain density, $\\rho$ is water density, $\\epsilon$ is the ratio of bankfull to critical shear stress, and $\\tau_c^*$ is the critical Shields stress (i.e., dimensionless critical shear stress). Using $g=9.8$ m/s$^2$, $\\rho_s=2,650$ kg/m$^3$ (quartz), $\\rho=1,000$ kg/m$^3$, $\\epsilon=0.2$, and $\\tau_c^*=0.0495$ (from Wong & Parker, 2006), the value of $k_b$ is approximately 2.61 s/m$^{1/2}$ (as calculated below)."

    "Note that one aspect of the above width theory that may limit its applicability is the prediction that width should *increase* when slope increases. To appreciate where this comes from, recall that boundary shear stress in a relatively wide channel is proportional to the depth-slope product (i.e., $\\tau \\approx \\rho g H S$, where $H$ is depth and $S$ is slope). All else equal, for a fixed shear stress, a steeper channel should be shallower and vice versa. For a given discharge, a shallower channel must either be wider or have faster flow, or both. So the prediction is logically and mathematically consistent. However, it neglects potential variations in roughness, and in particular the possibility that steeper channels might become rougher as the flow increases toward criticality (as suggested by Grant, 1997). The theory outlined here does not attempt to account for this effect, but users of the component should be aware of this limitation. In addition, the underlying treatment of shear stress as proportional to depth times slope is not appropriate for channels with a relatively small width-depth ratio. The component does not include any checks on this, so the user should be alert to unrealistic behavior when the calculated channel width is rather narrow."

    "#### Test: sediment flux and slope at headwater cells\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to test the steady mini-basin solution is to look at the headwater cells: those that receive no external water or sediment. When in equilibrium with a specified rate of baselevel lowering, a headwater cell should erode at the rate of baselevel lowering, $E$. This will effectively supply a quantity of sediment equal to the erosion rate times the cell area, $\\Lambda$, times the solid fraction, so that we can express the volume inflow of sediment to the cell from erosional lowering as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_\\text{bl} = (1-\\phi) E \\Lambda$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As sediment flows through and out of the cell, we should lose gravel to abrasion at a rate that depends on the abrasion coefficient, $\\beta$, the local gravel flux $Q_s$, and the length of the channel, which here is treated as the length of the grid link along which water flows, $\\lambda_f$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_\\text{abr} = \\beta \\lambda_f Q_s$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the component, the local sediment flux $Q_s$ is treated as the average of the incoming flux, $Q_\\text{in}$, and the outgoing flux, $Q_\\text{out}$. In a headwater cell, there's no influx, so the average of in and outflux is evaluated as $Q_s = Q_\\text{out} / 2$, and hence\n",

    "$$Q_\\text{abr} = \\beta \\lambda_f Q_\\text{out} / 2$$\n",

    "At equilibrium, the volume rate of sediment addition via erosional lowering equals the sum of the abrasion loss rate and the downstream transport rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_\\text{bl} = Q_\\text{out} + Q_\\text{abr}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Using the transport equation, we can then solve for the expected gradient of headwater cells. In doing so, we use the fact that $Q = r A$ and in this case $A = \\Lambda$ (i.e., drainage area equals the cell area, because there is no inflow of water besides local runoff generation):\n",

    "\n",
    "The `GravelRiverTransporter` component simulates a grid-based network of equilibrium-width, gravel-bed rivers in which gravel can be lost to abrasion downstream. The component is consistent with analytical solutions. One limitation of the examples shown here is that valley width is effectively uniform and equal to grid-cell width. Another limitation is that the component makes no attempt to evaluate whether the model's state variables are always consistent with the assumptions used to derive the underlying theory. For example, it is theoretically possible to have the implied channel width be so narrow that the wide-channel assumption no longer holds; similarly, it is possible to have an implied valley width larger than a single grid cell. It is also theoretically possible that the implied flow speed could become supercritical, which would be unrealistic. The user is cautioned to be aware of these limitations!\n",

    "As of this writing, the only fully implemented solver is a simple explicit, forward-Euler method. A matrix-based implicit solver is under construction but not fully operational. An explicit Runge-Kutta method would also be worth trying, as would an adaptive time-stepper."
