    "# GravelRiverTransporter\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes the `GravelRiverTransporter` component and its underlying theory, and provides some simple examples of usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "`GravelRiverTransporter` is a Landlab component for modeling landscape evolution in the context of a network of gravel-bed alluvial channels. The component is meant to operate in conjunction with a single-direction flow routing scheme, such that each grid cell drains to one and only one of its neighbors. Channels are assumed to be sub-grid-scale features with a bankfull channel width that adjusts according to the local discharge, slope, and grain diameter. The approach follows that of Wickert & Schildgen (2019), but with two additions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Because the channel network is calculated from, and embedded within, a topographic field represented as a 2d grid, conservation of mass is calculated on the basis of individual grid cells rather than using a prescribed valley width.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The component adds progressive loss of gravel load due to abrasion; the lost material is assumed to become part of the suspended and/or wash load, which is not explicitly tracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory that channels with gravel bed and bank materials tend to adjust their shear stress ratio dates back to Parker (1978), and a variety of studies have supported the idea for gravel rivers. Phillips and Jerolmack (2016) argued that the concept may also be applicable to some \"bedrock\" rivers as well (the question depends somewhat on the definition of \"bedrock river\", but presumably a river that is capable of eroding into bedrock but that also has at least one self-formed bank made of alluvial material would qualify as self-adjusting)."

    "### Channel-width adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "We treat only the coarse, bed-load fraction. We assume that channel width adjusts so as to ensure that bankfull shear stress is slightly larger (by a fraction $\\epsilon$) than critical shear stress for the median sediment diameter. Wickert & Schildgen (2019) show that when this is the case, the channel tends to adjust such that its bankfull width depends on bankfull discharge, $Q$, channel gradient, $S$, and the median diameter of sediment on the bed, $D$, as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$b = k_b \\frac{QS^{7/6}}{D^{3/2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k_b$ is a factor given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$k_b = 0.17 g^{-1/2} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\rho_s-\\rho}{\\rho}\\right)(1+\\epsilon )\\tau_c^*\\right]^{-5/3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g$ is gravitational acceleration, $\\rho_s$ is sediment grain density, $\\rho$ is water density, $\\epsilon$ is the ratio of bankfull to critical shear stress, and $\\tau_c^*$ is the critical Shields stress (i.e., dimensionless critical shear stress). Using $g=9.8$ m/s$^2$, $\\rho_s=2,650$ kg/m$^3$, $\\rho=1,000$ kg/m$^3$, $\\epsilon=0.2$, and $\\tau_c^*=0.0495$, the value of $k_b$ is approximately 2.61 s/m$^{1/2}$ (as calculated below)."

    "Note that one aspect of the above width theory that may limit its applicability is the prediction that width should *increase* when slope increases. To appreciate where this comes from, recall that boundary shear stress in a relatively wide channel is proportional to the depth-slope product. All else equal, for a fixed shear stress, a steeper channel should be shallower and vice versa. For a given discharge, a shallower channel must either be wider or have faster flow, or both. So the prediction is logically and mathematically consistent. However, it neglects potential variations in roughness, and in particular the possibility that steeper channels might become rougher as the flow increases toward criticality (as suggested by Gordon Grant in a famous 1997 paper). The theory outlined here does not attempt to account for this effect, but users of the component should be aware of this limitation. In addition, the underlying treatment of shear stress as proportional to depth times slope is not appropriate for channels with a relatively small width-depth ratio; the component does not include any checks on this, so the user should be alert to unrealistic behavior when the calculated channel width is rather narrow."
