    "# Cellular Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) Model\n",
    "\n",
    "*This notebook demonstrates how CellLab-CTS can be used to create a stochastic, cellular implementation of the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological model. For the original example, see Tucker et al. (2016, Geoscientific Model Development).*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The model domain consists of a hexagonal lattice of cells, representing individuals in a community. Each cell takes one of three possible states:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Susceptible:** the individual is susceptible to an infectious disease\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Infectious:** the individual is infected, and able to transmit the disease to their immediate neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recovered:** the individual has recovered and is immune to further infection\n",
    "\n",
    "As with all CellLab-CTS models, the dynamics are described by pairwise transition rules. In this case, there are just two transition rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) When an infectious cell is adjacent to a susceptible cell, the susceptible cell has a probability $P_i$ per unit time of becoming *infected*. This transition is represented by drawing the waiting time before infection occurs as a random number from an exponential distribution with a mean time-to-infection of $T_i = 1/P_i$. If the infectious cell recovers before then, infection does not take place.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) An infectious cell, regardless of its neighbor states, has a probability $P_r$ per unit time of *recovery*. This translates into an expected waiting time to recovery of $T_r = 1/P_r$, and it is implemented by drawing a time-to-recovery from an exponential distribution with mean $T_r$. Note that because of the lattice geometry, the actual expected recovery rate is $6/T_r$, and the expected recovery time is $T_r/6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the implementation below, the recovery time is set to unity, such that the infection rate is normalized by the recovery rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is implemented as a Python class, in the accompanying file `sir.py`. Here we import the class, create an instance with default parameters, and run it. The starting condition just has a single infected cell.\n"
