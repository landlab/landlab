### All inputs for Vegetation Cellular Automaton Model built on The Landlab
### can be given here.
### 14Feb2015 - Sai Nudurupati & Erkan Istanbulluoglu
### 15Jul2016 - Updated to comply with Landlab Version 1 naming conventions.

### There are some rules to use this input file:
###    1) The variable's identifier should not be changed, for e.g. 'mean_storm_dry'  is
###       the model input parameter. The code only understands this variable this way.
###       Anything following '#' can be changed (commented part).
###    2) A separator ':'  is used to define the end of the variable name.
###    3) Input value/string should be entered in the following (immediate) line of the variable name.
###    4) Nothing other than the input values should  be entered in this line (where value is entered).
###    5) A float value should always have a number in front of the decimal '.', e.g  '0.1' instead of '.1'
###       If not, the input will be read as a string value.
###    6) Any numeric input will be identified as a float if it contains '.'  . If a decimal point is not present,
###       the input will be read in as an int.
###    7) String inputs are also recognized.
